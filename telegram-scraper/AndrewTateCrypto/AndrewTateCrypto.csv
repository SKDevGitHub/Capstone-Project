All the coins we post will be part of the coins we believe have that extra chance of doing massive moves in the short term. 

In order to maintain stability in the coins we hold and only if needed, our team will support the prices of all our signals.

This strategy has worked for us many times in the past and allowed our members to generate millions of $ in profits over the last few years. However, the market has changed lately and we realize we need to change our strategy.

From now on, all our signals will be posted at random times without any prior notice. Whenever we see a good buying opportunity in the market, we will post it and allow our members to generate great profits quickly as well. This will allow our members to get a better entry in all our signals and allow the signals to grow organically with the market. Our team will be actively supporting all our signals as well to maximize profits for our community.

Stay tuned.",
