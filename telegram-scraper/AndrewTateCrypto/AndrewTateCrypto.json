The market is currently not at it's optimal level and for that reason we have decided to postpone the buy signal for 1 more week. Our upcoming futures signal will now be on Sunday 13th of April 2025 instead, it will definitely be worth the wait. Stay tuned.",

We have had a strong and successful track record of signaling spot coins on Cex over the last few years that have given results of up to 2000% profit and with the market changing and evolving we need to adjust accordingly. Our initial thoughts were to start signaling coins on Dex since this is where most people are trading nowadays but we will keep that thought for another day. For now, our team has decided that we are going to start signaling coins in the futures market since this is also where most of the volume is nowadays. The coins we signal will generally be listed on most exchanges since our picks will only be coins that are well established and have good fundamentals in order to ensure good liquidity for everyone regardless of bidding size. \n\n\nWe have exactly 7 days to prepare for this massive futures signal which will take place on Sunday April 6 2025 at 16:00 GMT. We expect this signal to make everyone a lot of profits very quickly, stay tuned for more updates to come leading up to the signal.",
