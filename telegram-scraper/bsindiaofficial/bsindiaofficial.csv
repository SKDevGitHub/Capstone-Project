ü©∫ Symptoms like fatigue, nausea, and jaundice are often overlooked ‚Äî and many cases are caught only through routine tests.

This World Liver Day, experts and the Government of India are urging early screening and simple lifestyle changes:

 ‚úÖ Annual liver function tests

 ‚úÖ A diet rich in greens, fruits, whole grains & healthy fats

 ‚úÖ Cut down refined sugar, fried foods, and oil

 ‚úÖ Regular exercise

üì¢ Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda and PM Narendra Modi are calling for a nationwide push to reduce edible oil intake and fight rising liver diseases ‚Äî especially in urban India.
