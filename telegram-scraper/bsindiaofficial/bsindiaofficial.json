        "message": "🟢 World Liver Day 2025: It’s not just about alcohol anymore\n\nMost people think liver disease is caused only by drinking. But doctors are sounding the alarm: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now more common than alcohol-induced cirrhosis in India. And it’s being driven by sugar, refined carbs, sedentary lifestyles, and yes — excessive cooking oil.\n\n🩺 Symptoms like fatigue, nausea, and jaundice are often overlooked — and many cases are caught only through routine tests.\n\nThis World Liver Day, experts and the Government of India are urging early screening and simple lifestyle changes:\n\n ✅ Annual liver function tests\n\n ✅ A diet rich in greens, fruits, whole grains & healthy fats\n\n ✅ Cut down refined sugar, fried foods, and oil\n\n ✅ Regular exercise\n\n📢 Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda and PM Narendra Modi are calling for a nationwide push to reduce edible oil intake and fight rising liver diseases — especially in urban India.\n\nLiver health is not just a medical issue — it’s a national one. Your liver does so much for you. This year, do something for it.\n\n📰 Read more: https://mybs.in/2emHfFb",
