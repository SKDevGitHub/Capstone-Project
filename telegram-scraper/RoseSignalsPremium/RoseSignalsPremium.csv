‚ÄúWe have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they‚Äôre going to be fair deals, and in certain cases, they‚Äôre going to be paying substantial tariffs.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a great relationship with Japan. We‚Äôre going to keep it that way, but they‚Äôre coming in to meet.‚Äù

Trump tells reporters that he has a ‚Äúgreat relationship with China's President Xi, it‚Äôs going to stay that way. Hopefully we‚Äôll get along with China. If we do, that‚Äôs great, and if we don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs OK too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to start paying debt off with tariffs and other things.‚Äù

Trump says ‚Äúone of the ways‚Äù to eliminate the trade deficit with the EU is for the EU to buy US energy.

Trump: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only tariffs, it‚Äôs non-monetary tariffs. It‚Äôs tariffs where they put things on that make it impossible for you to sell a car. So, tariffs are a big part of it, but there‚Äôs another big part of it, and that‚Äôs barriers,‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country. We have an opportunity to reset the table on trade.‚Äù This is ‚Äúthe only chance we‚Äôre going to have to reset the table on trade, and when we do, we‚Äôre going to come out, unbelievably well.‚Äù

Trump touts USMCA, the trade deal with Canada and Mexico, and then says: ‚ÄúThey cheat like crazy. Canada cheats, Mexico cheats.‚Äù

Trump on what kind of deal Israel would get on tariffs: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not taking care of our enemies anymore, but we do take care of our friends.‚Äù
