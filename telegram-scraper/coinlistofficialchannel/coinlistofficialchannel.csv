After a difficult chapter in American crypto history, we’re reopening token sales for U.S. accredited investors.

Because when America builds, the entire crypto ecosystem moves forward.

Since our last U.S. token sale in 2019, crypto (ex-BTC) has 18x’d—$60B → $1.15T.

Meanwhile, U.S. participants were largely excluded from top projects like Solana, Near, Ondo, and WalletConnect who launched on CoinList.

It's time to change that.
