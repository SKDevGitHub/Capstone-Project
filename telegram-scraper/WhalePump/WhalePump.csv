Still nothing clear, but still pointing towards correction.",

Why? Because as mentioned above, long term players are back accumulating strong. Bitcoin are changing hands. Two forces are at work and it's unclear who is winning.",10675

Large support now materialized in OBs around 87.5k.

Remains to be seen if spoof or real.

I read as follow:

Long term players back accumulating strong.
Short term players distributing profit from last low buys.

I was telling you whales were buying, and I was accumulating.

Many freaked out and many capitulated.

I was telling you to keep your eyes on the chart the next few weeks.

What now?

When will you learn?",
10664,2025-04-23 00:01:48,-1001285840493,,,,"Since then I repeated a trillion time:

Never leverage.
Never sell your BTC.
Always have most of your wealth in BTC.
Never put more than a few % of your BR in another coin.
Inject profit back in BTC.

All you had to do is follow the rules.
You would be so rich.

Guess what, you can still follow them.

BTC
+ SDEX 
+ LINK
+ ETH

That's the play for now.

I called $120k BTC when it was 4k.

Everyone I knew laughed at my post.

Then we bought it back at these levels in March 2020.

Those who lived the moment will never forget.

What if I told you, you can still follow the rules?

And in a few years you will look back at today with the same smile we look back at 2019?

Embrace the vol. and have fun, we are going to make it.",
