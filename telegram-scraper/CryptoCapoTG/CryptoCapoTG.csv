Not much to update. Just riding this bullish move and took the weekend to fully disconnect from crypto.

Still waiting for the targets above to be reached, and for ltf bearish signs, before starting to take profits.

Analysis playing out. I still think $BTC can push a bit higher towards $95k‚Äì96k, and alts even higher.

Many people have asked me for this, so here it is.

I consider ENA a mid-term investment. That's why I'm just holding it until August-September (subject to change / adaptation)

We can see how it has formed a massive range. Bearish trend is very oversold here, so a bounce to $0.50-0.55 keeps making sense. After that, we could see the last capitulation event I've been talking about previously. If that happens, I will buy more. If not, just hold.",1118

New tariffs started today, April 9, 2025: 20% on EU stuff, 34% extra on Chinese goods (54% total), and 104% on some Chinese imports.

Bitcoin price didn't react too bad to this event. In fact, it seems to be forming a double bottom formation above March's low. This could be another sign of strength for a local bottom formation.

There's also a lot of liquidity at $85k (second image). If $BTC manages to reclaim that level, then we should see a further short-term bullish move towards $92k-98k, where the bearish trend should resume.",

While sharing quick updates has worked so far, the format can get messy over time. Especially when it comes to tracking my current positioning, thesis updates, invalidations, or risk adjustments.

Sometimes I‚Äôll post an analysis on a coin, enter a position, and then quickly change plans if the setup invalidates. But the nature of social media makes it easy for people to cherry-pick old posts and ignore everything that came after.

This isn‚Äôt about being ‚Äúright‚Äù all the time. I‚Äôve said it before: I don‚Äôt pretend to be perfect. The market evolves, and I adapt. That‚Äôs what trading is.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working on changing how I structure my content going forward.

The goal is to make it easier to follow:

‚Äì Clear separation between market updates, setups, educational posts, mindset, offtopic, etc.
‚Äì Easier tracking of my current view and any changes
‚Äì Better context on why things shift and how I manage risk when they do

This should make everything more transparent and valuable. Not just for me, but for those who actually care about learning and improving in this space.

Open to suggestions. DMs on X are always welcome.

Thanks for the support as always!",
