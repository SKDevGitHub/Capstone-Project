I consider ENA a mid-term investment. That's why I'm just holding it until August-September (subject to change / adaptation)

We can see how it has formed a massive range. Bearish trend is very oversold here, so a bounce to $0.50-0.55 keeps making sense. After that, we could see the last capitulation event I've been talking about previously. If that happens, I will buy more. If not, just hold.",1118

New tariffs started today, April 9, 2025: 20% on EU stuff, 34% extra on Chinese goods (54% total), and 104% on some Chinese imports.

Bitcoin price didn't react too bad to this event. In fact, it seems to be forming a double bottom formation above March's low. This could be another sign of strength for a local bottom formation.

There's also a lot of liquidity at $85k (second image). If $BTC manages to reclaim that level, then we should see a further short-term bullish move towards $92k-98k, where the bearish trend should resume.",

While sharing quick updates has worked so far, the format can get messy over time. Especially when it comes to tracking my current positioning, thesis updates, invalidations, or risk adjustments.

Sometimes I‚Äôll post an analysis on a coin, enter a position, and then quickly change plans if the setup invalidates. But the nature of social media makes it easy for people to cherry-pick old posts and ignore everything that came after.

This isn‚Äôt about being ‚Äúright‚Äù all the time. I‚Äôve said it before: I don‚Äôt pretend to be perfect. The market evolves, and I adapt. That‚Äôs what trading is.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working on changing how I structure my content going forward.

The goal is to make it easier to follow:

‚Äì Clear separation between market updates, setups, educational posts, mindset, offtopic, etc.
‚Äì Easier tracking of my current view and any changes
‚Äì Better context on why things shift and how I manage risk when they do

This should make everything more transparent and valuable. Not just for me, but for those who actually care about learning and improving in this space.

Open to suggestions. DMs on X are always welcome.

Crazy PA yesterday... and this is exactly why I avoid leverage most of the time.

Right now, $BTC is just deviating above and below the $84k‚Äì85k area, flip-flopping and trying to find direction.

Indicators remain bullish for the short-term, so I still think a move up is more likely. But once again, we need to see a clean reclaim of $85k to confirm that.

As long as that happens, the target would be $92k-98k, which is the next strong resistance zone.",

I see it differently. Most of the tariff news is likely already priced in. The market has been dropping for weeks.

Bitcoin has been showing weakness since February, and in my opinion, this will likely end with a capitulation event at some point.

That said, as I‚Äôve mentioned over the last few days, indicators are flashing local bottom signals in the short term.
Sentiment is extremely negative, prices are very oversold, and most altcoins are at major support levels‚Äîforming higher lows, just like BTC.

Based on that, I believe we could see another short squeeze / bull trap soon, possibly pushing $BTC up to the $95k area, with altcoins likely outperforming.

Note: For this short-term scenario to play out, BTC must reclaim $84k, which remains a key level.",
