We have had a strong and successful track record of signaling spot coins on Dex over the last few years that have given results of up to 2000% profit and with the market changing and evolving we need to adjust accordingly. Our initial thoughts were to start signaling coins on Dex since this is where most people are trading nowadays but we will keep that thought for another day. For now, our team has decided that we are going to start signaling coins in the futures market since this is also where most of the volume is nowadays. The coins we signal will generally be listed on most exchanges since our picks will only be coins that are well established and have good fundamentals in order to ensure good liquidity for everyone regardless of bidding size.",
