I am one of your viewers who was watching your youtube video previous year in order to qualify CUET PG examination.
I have got admission in MBA finance DAVV.
Sir You had recommended DAVV as 2nd best college under CUET.
Sir but beleive me it is looking like I am just wasting my parents money here.
The classes are not being conducted properly.
Even syllabus are only 50% completed in each semester.
Faculties are dedicated only in the first month. 
I am not complaining but yeah I think agar ush time koi guidance k liye hota ki beta aap thoda wait krlo or CAT CMAT etc ki potential hai toh ush side lg jao... Bhale drop lele.... So i think it would be better.....
I really want you to please create a video on this issue... Aap baccho ko thoda guide kr do ki agar apke pass better option hai toh usey choose karo... Yha DAVV worth nhi hai....
Sir Mai UP se yha MP aai... Ghr jane m 29hrs lg jate hai....
Kya fyda ghar se itne dur itni struggling life zii kr jab yaha ana worth nahi hai....
If My parents are paying 2lakh each year( including living expenses) then I think It's wastage of money because classes conduct nahi ho rhe properly.....
Padhai youtube se krni padti hai..",
