They may change their rhetoric on a daily basis creating deep uncertainty.\nThat is the main cause of volatility now.📈\n\nThe foundation of any reliable and profitable trading strategy is patterns, whether fundamental or technical analysis patterns: certain events that have a similar nature and lead the markets to predictable outcomes.\n\nWith the current actions of the US government, at least for me, it is extremely complicated to find any reliable pattern now.\nFor now, it looks like complete chaos. And that is the main reason why so many strategies fail.💧\n\nAs I have said multiple times, when the markets are worrying and unsettled, the best thing you can do is to wait for them to calm down.

        "message": "Traders, as this week started with many gaps and volatilize movements, I want to warn you one more time about high volatility risks.❗️\n\nThe current storm that we see on the market is NOT EASY at all to trade. Abnormally high volatility caused by the panic and extensive shifts in the macroeconomic environment make every intraday trading position extremely weak.\n\nWhy? Because the rapid and extended intraday price movements can easily kick us from the trades way before going in the desired directions.\nThe risks of being stop hunted are very high at the moment, and you should think many times before you open any trade.🧠\n\nAs the situation is not stabilizing, I strictly recommend using reduced risk per trade. For example, if in normal times you risk 1% per trade, risk 0.5% now.\n\nMany \"gurus\" out there claim that high volatility provides the greatest opportunity to make money now. They forget to add that it is also the greatest moment to lose everything you have.\n\nBe careful, traders, remember that the key to survival is patience, discipline, and gradual learning—rather than chasing fast profits in unpredictable conditions.\n\nLet's hope that the markets will calm down soon.🧘",

A perfect strategy does not exist and losses are inevitable.\nYour job as a trader is to learn to overcome it and keep being calm and patient.\n\nHave a great weekend, traders!",
