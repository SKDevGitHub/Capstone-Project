1️⃣ #AUDUSD daily time frame 🇦🇺🇺🇸

The pair has completed a bullish accumulation and violated
a resistance line of a horizontal range on a daily.
A new higher high higher close confirms a strong bullish sentiment
and a highly probably continuation of an uptrend.

2️⃣ #EURAUD daily time frame 🇪🇺🇦🇺

The price has recently violated a significant daily support cluster.
After a breakout, the price dropped but did not manage
to reach any important demand zone so far.
The closest one is based on 1.742 level.
It will most likely be the next goal for the sellers.

3️⃣ #US100 daily time frame

massive daily demand cluster.

and the price will reach 20300.

4️⃣ #CHFJPY daily time frame 🇨🇭🇯🇵

zone based on a rising trend line and a horizontal support.

Over the last week, I have started to receive many requests asking me to explain/share a strategy to trade the Trump tariffs.
Well, the worst thing about the actions of his administration now is that they are completely unpredictable. They may change their rhetoric on a daily basis creating deep uncertainty.
That is the main cause of volatility now.📈

The foundation of any reliable and profitable trading strategy is patterns, whether fundamental or technical analysis patterns: certain events that have a similar nature and lead the markets to predictable outcomes.

With the current actions of the US government, at least for me, it is extremely complicated to find any reliable pattern now.
For now, it looks like complete chaos. And that is the main reason why so many strategies fail.💧

As I have said multiple times, when the markets are worrying and unsettled, the best thing you can do is to wait for them to calm down. Quite often there are the periods when the best strategy is to not trade, and now it might be one of those.

9206,2025-04-11 20:53:01,-1001169143349,,,,"Man, this tariff war is becoming more and more annoying. 

I must say that just watching the charts this week was overwhelming.
Usually, I adjust/redraw my charts on Monday mornings, but this week, I updated my charts DAILY because of the number of breakouts and violations.🤯

With an extreme volatility on ALL THE MARKETS this week, I kept receiving the messages from the subscribers about blow accounts.
The FOMO effect and the panic that were triggered by major moves make many traders jump in the market, hoping to see more growth/drop.
Such emotional decisions cause extremely high losses.🤕

What also worries me is that it is still not clear what are going to be the real repercussions of a ""new tariff era"".
It is hard to predict how it all is going to change our lives and how it will affect the costs of living.
And it certainly will… 

What I am happy about is that the market will close soon and for the next 2 days the charts will be frozen.❄️

I wish you all a great weekend and, please, be careful.
If you feel a strong psychological pressure placing any trade, that's the signal to take a pause, brother.",

📉NZDCHF is trading in a strong bearish trend on a daily.
After a yesterday's pullback caused by FOMC,
the price reached a key horizontal resistance.

After a consolidation on that, the pair leaves clear bearish clues.
I see a formation of a bearish imbalance candle and a remaining
bearish pressure after US CPI.
