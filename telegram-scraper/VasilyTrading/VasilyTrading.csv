Over the last week, I have started to receive many requests asking me to explain/share a strategy to trade the Trump tariffs.
Well, the worst thing about the actions of his administration now is that they are completely unpredictable. They may change their rhetoric on a daily basis creating deep uncertainty.
That is the main cause of volatility now.📈

The foundation of any reliable and profitable trading strategy is patterns, whether fundamental or technical analysis patterns: certain events that have a similar nature and lead the markets to predictable outcomes.

With the current actions of the US government, at least for me, it is extremely complicated to find any reliable pattern now.
For now, it looks like complete chaos. And that is the main reason why so many strategies fail.💧

As I have said multiple times, when the markets are worrying and unsettled, the best thing you can do is to wait for them to calm down. Quite often there are the periods when the best strategy is to not trade, and now it might be one of those.

I must say that just watching the charts this week was overwhelming.
Usually, I adjust/redraw my charts on Monday mornings, but this week, I updated my charts DAILY because of the number of breakouts and violations.🤯

With an extreme volatility on ALL THE MARKETS this week, I kept receiving the messages from the subscribers about blow accounts.
The FOMO effect and the panic that were triggered by major moves make many traders jump in the market, hoping to see more growth/drop.
Such emotional decisions cause extremely high losses.🤕

What also worries me is that it is still not clear what are going to be the real repercussions of a ""new tariff era"".
It is hard to predict how it all is going to change our lives and how it will affect the costs of living.
And it certainly will… 

What I am happy about is that the market will close soon and for the next 2 days the charts will be frozen.❄️

I wish you all a great weekend and, please, be careful.

The current storm that we see on the market is NOT EASY at all to trade. Abnormally high volatility caused by the panic and extensive shifts in the macroeconomic environment make every intraday trading position extremely weak.

Why? Because the rapid and extended intraday price movements can easily kick us from the trades way before going in the desired directions.
The risks of being stop hunted are very high at the moment, and you should think many times before you open any trade.🧠

As the situation is not stabilizing, I strictly recommend using reduced risk per trade. For example, if in normal times you risk 1% per trade, risk 0.5% now.

Many ""gurus"" out there claim that high volatility provides the greatest opportunity to make money now. They forget to add that it is also the greatest moment to lose everything you have.

Be careful, traders, remember that the key to survival is patience, discipline, and gradual learning—rather than chasing fast profits in unpredictable conditions.

Let's hope that the markets will calm down soon.🧘",

Here are the updates & outlook for multiple instruments in my watch list.

1️⃣ #EURUSD daily time frame 🇪🇺🇺🇸

For the last 2 weeks, EURUSD shows a strong bearish momentum.
The price managed to break and close below a key daily support cluster.

A strong bearish reaction that followed after its retest confirms a strong
selling pressure.

I think that the pair has a potential to drop lower this week.

2️⃣ #GBPUSD daily time frame 🇬🇧🇺🇸

In comparison to EURUSD, GBPUSD looks very stable.
The pair is consolidating within quite a wide range on a daily.
For now, probabilities are high that sideways movement will continue.
Consider trading the upper and lower boundary of the underlined channel.

Alternatively, a breakout of one of the underlined structures will give you a strong
bullish/breaish signal.

3️⃣ #USDJPY daily time frame 🇺🇸🇯🇵

Looks like the market is returning to a mid-term bearish trend.
The price is currently breaking a support line of a bearish flag pattern.

A daily candle close below its support will provide a strong bearish confirmation.

4️⃣ #AUDUSD daily time frame 🇦🇺🇺🇸

I see a completed head & shoulders pattern on a daily.
The price is currently breaking its neckline.

A daily candle close below that will provide a strong bearish confirmation
and suggest a highly probable bearish continuation.

Do you agree with my market breakdown?",

A formation of a bullish imbalance candle on an hourly

Checking my stats for this month, the first half of that was a tough one, with a losing streak that we faced with my students.

The second half of the month, conversely, was good with a nice winning streak being caught and all the losses being recovered.📈

As the month started with bad trades, some members of my vip group stopped following the strategy after they encountered the drawdown.
Instead of being patient, they started crying that the strategy does not work anymore and needed to be revised. 💩

Because of the decision to drop, they miss the opportunity to recover the losses that the strategy provided and when the markets stopped being that stubborn.

That is the exemplary case how consistency is important in trading.
Your ability to follow your strategy with discipline even in times of losses is essential for staying afloat.

Jumping to another strategy after facing the losses is a very common mistake that a lot of newbie traders make. ✅

Always trust your system, don't drop it if it shows negative statistics in some periods. A perfect strategy does not exist and losses are inevitable.
Your job as a trader is to learn to overcome it and keep being calm and patient.

Have a great weekend, traders!",
