        "message": "What are fair estimates for how much % of offshore wealth Monero can capture\n\nEstimating the percentage of offshore wealth that Monero (XMR) could capture is speculative, but we can analyze its potential based on current trends, adoption drivers, and limitations. Below is a structured breakdown:\n\n1. Current Offshore Wealth vs. Monero’s Market Share**\n\nTotal offshore wealth: ~$7–$12 trillion (real estate, cash, gold, etc.)\n\nMonero’s current market cap: ~$2–$4 billion (fluctuates with crypto markets).  \n- Existing penetration: < 0.1% of offshore wealth (mostly darknet markets, privacy-conscious users).  \n\n---\n\n2. Realistic Adoption Scenarios (Next 5–10 Years)\n\nA. Baseline Estimate (Conservative)** 0.5–2% of offshore wealth**  \n   - Assumptions:  \n     - Monero grows like Swiss bank accounts in the 1980s (niche but trusted).  \n     - Used mainly by:  \n       - Privacy-focused high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs).  \n       - Darknet markets (stable demand).  \n       - Sanctions evaders (e.g., Russia, Iran, Venezuela).  \n   - Projected market share: $35–$240 billion (0.5–2% of $7T–$12T).  \n\nB. Aggressive Estimate (If Crypto Privacy Booms)**: 3–5%  \n   - Assumptions:  \n     - Governments crack down on traditional tax havens (Panama, Switzerland).  \n     - Monero becomes the \"offshore bank account\" of crypto.  \n     - Institutional adoption (e.g., hedge funds use XMR for confidential trades).  \n   - Projected market share: $210–$600 billion.  \n\n#### C. Upper Limit (If Fiat Systems Fail): 5–10%  \n   - Assumptions:  \n     - Hyperinflation or capital controls push wealth into censorship-resistant assets.  \n     - Monero dominates privacy coin sector (no competitors).  \n   - Projected market share: $600B–$1.2 trillion.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Key Drivers for Monero Adoption  \n1. Regulatory Crackdowns on Traditional Havens (FATCA, CRS).  \n2. Demand for Untraceable Stores of Value (vs. Bitcoin’s transparency).  \n3. Darknet Markets & Illicit Flow (stable ~$1B/year demand).  \n4. Institutional Interest (if privacy becomes monetized).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Challenges Limiting Growth  \n- Regulatory Bans: Exchanges delist XMR (e.g., Binance 2024).  \n- Competition: Zcash, Bitcoin + CoinJoin, CBDCs with privacy features.  \n- Scalability: Monero’s blockchain is heavier than Bitcoin’s.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Comparison to Other Offshore Assets  \n| Asset          | Estimated Offshore Share | Why?                          |  \n|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|  \n| Swiss Banks | ~25%                     | Tradition, stability          |  \n| Dubai Real Estate | ~10%          | Anonymity + luxury            |  \n| Gold       | ~5%                      | Physical, untraceable         |  \n| Monero (Potential) | 0.5–5%       | Digital, programmable privacy |  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Verdict: Monero’s Offshore Potential  \n- Short-term (2025–2030): 0.5–2% (~$35–$240B).  \n- Long-term (If Privacy Demand Explodes): Up to 5% (~$600B).  \n- Best-Case (Black Swan Event): 10%+ (unlikely without mass adoption).",

The government doesn’t allow drugs !! \n\nYet many ppl still want them \n\nCocaine trading at $20,000-$40,000 per kg \n\nand just cocaine alone, 2 million kgs are produced per year\n\nIn comparison to #Monero (0.9% inflation right now) where there is less supply than Bitcoin still, and less inflation than gold (2%) or drugs \n\nWhat a lot of you don’t realize is \n\nJust like you can hide gold or cash \n\nYou have the chance to do that with Monero right now while it’s still legal and obtainable \n\nWhen this becomes unobtainable, it’s gonna be much harder for most people to get their hands on large amounts of XMR\n\nYou may think that’s “bearish” but it will actually raise the perceived value of 1 Monero, when the use and need for it stays or grows exponentially and people in the world still need it whether it’s legal or not \n\n1 Monero will become greater in value than 1kg of cocaine\n\nLess supply. Less inflation. More transporatable.\n\nAnd instead of being the PRODUCT, it is the MONEY that buys PRODUCTS making it even more needed than the products themselves. \n\nFor example you want to buy a chair, car, laptop. \n\nWell you need USD to buy it. \n\nSo 99.9% hold and desire some USD as a result to swap into those things. \n\nYou won’t use Monero for a purchase like a car or house \n\nBut Monero serves different purchase purposes, ones that don’t need to be reported to the govt or so logged\n\nThis can include helping a local farmer, online purchases, coffee shops and restaurants, drug trade, gambling and more \n\nYou “governments won’t let it happen” ppl are idiots \n\nSame exact thing was said about Bitcoin.\n\nStack up on Monero while you still can. \n\nYou don’t want to be the guy without toilet paper when the time comes.",

Look at the volume\n\n150M volume on a 17M market cap coin that nobody knows about or cares about \n\nTheory: if they own 80-99% of the supply\n\nAnd want to offload supply or just make money by liquidating people in both directions\n\nHow would u do that best \n\nOne way is to SPOT BUY on top of leverage longs you have on a coin u own 80-99% of here \n\nIf they spot buy on top of their leverage longs, then they are making their leverage longs go in profit and pushing up the price \n\nAt the same time they can lure in and liquidate short sellers, or liquidate long buyers like us who come in on leverage and therefore profit in both directions \n\nAnyways there’s some paths of thought here or ways this could work\n\nBut main point is I think it’s at a bullish setup here with way more upside than downside potential from this point\n\nAnd if u think from their shoes I think it makes way more sense to try and push it higher rn if any of the things im guessing hold any % of truth",
