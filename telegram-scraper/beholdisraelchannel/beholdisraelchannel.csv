54294,2025-05-07 07:05:49,-1001361890342,,,,"After Trump's announcement last night, there are two options.
The one where Trump surrendered to the Houthis and the Iranians, abandoned Israel and ""threw it under the bus,"" as some commentators are quick to celebrate in defiance.
The second is that he uses his negotiation methods that include chaos and uncertainty specifically against the Iranians and the Houthis with the aim of achieving achievements and successes with the Saudis and Qataris next week.
I believe that the second option is the correct one.

- Trump with his eyes on the ball - to win the trade war with China.
- In his opinion, the path there goes through separating Russia and Iran from the alliance with China, while at the same time strengthening the India-Saudi Arabia-Gulf alliance.
- He is arriving next week to close a deal with Saudi Arabia, which has been demanding a defense alliance from the US for years (both against the Houthis and against Iran).
- If he puts their minds at ease, Trump will return with a fat check of at least $500 billion in Saudi investments that will drive the American economy despite the tariff war.
- Next week he wants to ""settle a deal"" on expanding the Abraham Accords with Saudi Arabia and perhaps Qatar as well, and is trying to please them.
This is his mission for the next two weeks and the rest (Ukraine and Israel) will wait.

But, all of this is not at the expense of the alliance with Israel.
- Israel needed a lot of armaments from the US and a free hand in Gaza and Syria, and it received both generously.
- Israel announced that it will fight and defend itself against any enemy that tries to harm it - the Houthis, Hamas and Iran - the US is not stopping us - the last time we acted today at noon.

Trump is creating a ""space of denial"" both internally and internationally, claiming that Israel is independent in conducting its wars and defending itself, and that the US is not conducting our wars. But he will provide support in the event that we are attacked, even if it is after we attack Iran.

The big unknown is what will happen with Iran?
On the face of it, the American minimum does not come close to the Iranian maximum in concessions, and the gaps are large. It also does not appear that Trump - the ""manly man"" - will suddenly bow down to Khamenei, who only six months ago sent an assassin to kill him. If there is an agreement, the Iranians will fold.
And in the meantime, in a (real) attempt to reach an agreement, the parties agreed not to discuss stopping the production of ballistic missiles, but miraculously their production chain was hit this week by a series of mysterious explosions.
So even if the US does not ultimately send B52 bombers with bunker-busting bombs to the centrifuges deep underground - but instead takes out the enriched material in the agreement, Israel can still bomb the rest of the nuclear program's facilities. And it doesn't seem that after Trump gets what he wants from Saudi Arabia, he will shed a tear over such an attack.
Not to mention that Trump's US will stand by to defend Israel from a counterattack - at least like the Biden administration.

In short, I wouldn't rush to eulogize the honeymoon between Trump and Netanyahu, quite the opposite.

54283,2025-05-07 05:15:20,-1001361890342,,,,"So what is the background to the recent India- Pakistan exchange of punches? 

On the night of May 6, 2025, India conducted military strikes, dubbed Operation Sindoor, targeting nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which it described as ""terrorist infrastructure."" The Indian military stated these sites, including the headquarters of Islamist militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, were used to plan and direct attacks against India, specifically in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack on April 22, 2025, in Indian-administered Kashmir. This attack killed 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, and was the deadliest civilian assault in the region since 2008. India accused Pakistan of harboring militants responsible for the Pahalgam attack, claiming two of the three suspects were Pakistani nationals, though it did not publicly detail its evidence.

Pakistan denied any involvement in the Pahalgam attack, rejected India’s claims, and condemned the strikes as an ""act of war,"" reporting that eight civilians, including a child and two teenagers, were killed and 35 others injured. Pakistani officials stated the strikes hit six locations, including Kotli, Muzaffarabad, Bahawalpur, and Muridke, and claimed none were militant camps. Pakistan’s military also claimed to have shot down five Indian aircraft, a claim India did not confirm, though four sources in Indian Kashmir reported three Indian jets crashed in the region.

The strikes were motivated by India’s assertion that Pakistan-based terrorists were responsible for the Pahalgam attack, escalating tensions after weeks of diplomatic fallout, including India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty and border closures. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed a ""forceful response,"" and the conflict has raised fears of further escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals.

This is the most significant Indian military action against Pakistan since 2019, when similar strikes followed a militant attack in Kashmir.",

As part of the operation, infrastructure belonging to the Houthi terrorist organization at the airport in the Sana'a area was destroyed, as well as a number of power stations that were used for terrorist purposes.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:
 ""I have said many times that whoever attacks the State of Israel - let his blood be on his head. Yesterday I said that the attack by the Houthis will be answered not with 'bang and we're done' - but with 'bangs.' So yesterday we dealt a bang, a hard blow to the port of Hodeidah.

A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck and dismantled Houthi terrorist infrastructure at the main airport in Sana’a, fully disabling the airport. The strike was carried out in response to the attack launched by the Houthi terrorist regime against Ben Gurion Airport. Flight runways, aircraft, and infrastructure at the airport were struck.

Similar to the Hudaydah Port that was struck yesterday, the airport served as a central hub for the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons and operatives. It has been routinely used by the Houthi regime for terrorist purposes. This underscores the Houthi terrorist regime’s brutal exploitation of civilian infrastructure for terrorist activity.

Furthermore, several central power plants were struck in the Sana’a area. The terrorist regime exploits energy infrastructure—an additional example of the Houthi regime’s use of Yemeni civilian infrastructure for terrorist purposes.

In addition, the IDF struck the “Al Imran” Concrete Plant, located north of Sana’a, which serves as a significant resource for the Houthi terrorist regime and is used for the construction of underground tunnels and other terrorist infrastructure. This strike further degrades the Houthi regime’s economic and military buildup capabilities.

The strikes were carried out with prevision, and steps were taken to mitigate harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure.

This operation was approved by the Commanding Officer of the IAF and the Chief of the General Staff.

Over the past year and a half, the Houthi terrorist regime has been operating under Iranian direction and funding, with the goal of targeting the State of Israel and its allies, undermining regional stability, and disrupting global freedom of navigation.

The IDF is determined to continue operating—at any distance—against all threats posed to the citizens of the State of Israel.",

In accordance with the plan formulated by the Chief of Staff and the IDF Command and approved by the Minister of Defense and the Prime Minister, the IDF will increase its forces and act forcefully to defeat and subdue Hamas and destroy its military and governmental capabilities, while creating strong pressure to release all the hostages.

A strong protective envelope will be provided to the forces maneuvering from land, air and sea, while using heavy equipment to neutralize explosive devices and destroy threatening structures.

A central component of the plan is a large-scale evacuation of the entire Gazan population from the fighting zones, including northern Gaza, to areas in southern Gaza, while creating a distinction between them and Hamas terrorists - to allow the IDF operational freedom of action.

Unlike in the past, the IDF will remain in any area that is conquered, to prevent the return of terrorism, and will handle any area that is cleansed according to the Rafah model, where all threats were eliminated and it became part of the security zone.

The humanitarian closure will continue, and only after the start of operational activity and the extensive evacuation of the population to the south, will a humanitarian plan be implemented, as presented yesterday by the IDF and approved by the cabinet, which will differentiate between aid and Hamas by operating civilian companies and demarcating the area to be secured by the IDF, including demarcating a sterile area in the Rafah area beyond the Morag axis where those entering will be filtered by the IDF to prevent the presence of Hamas members.

The deployment of forces prior to the start of the maneuver will allow a window of opportunity until the end of the US President's visit to the region to carry out a hostage deal according to the ""Witkoff model."" In such a case, Israel will strive to retain areas that have been cleared and added to the security zone beyond the March lines. In any temporary or permanent arrangement, Israel will not vacate the security zone around Gaza, which is intended to protect the communities and prevent weapons smuggling to Hamas. 

If a hostage deal is not reached, Operation Gideon's Chariots will begin with great intensity and will not stop until all its objectives are achieved.

The voluntary transfer program for Gaza residents, especially those who will be concentrated in the south outside Hamas control, will be part of the operation's goals.",

The ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which has been going on for over 18 months against Hamas and other Iranian proxies, continues to be waged largely underground. The main factor making it difficult for the IDF to win the campaign is the “Gaza Metro” – a vast and intricate network of terror tunnels, built over years with the help of generous foreign aid and indirect encouragement from the international community.

An investigation published in recent days in the international media suggests that countries, aid organizations, and even media outlets ignored the warning signs for a long time, and indirectly enabled Gaza to become an underground labyrinth of fighting.

In January 2025, Yoni Ben-Menachem, a researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Foreign and Security Affairs, said: ""About 40% of the tunnel network still exists - these are hundreds of kilometers of terrorist infrastructure that the IDF was unaware of."" According to him, ""There are very long tunnels that have not yet been located, and some of them are used to hold hostages. To deal with them, a large-scale operation and a huge amount of explosives are required - which Israel does not currently have.""

Rubio stated, “If Iran wants a peaceful civilian nuclear program, meaning they want nuclear power plants like other countries have, there’s a way to do that. It involves building reactors and importing enriched uranium to fuel them. That’s how dozens of countries worldwide operate.”

“The only countries in the world that enrich uranium are those with nuclear weapons. Iran claims it doesn’t want weapons, but what they’re essentially asking for is to be the only non-nuclear-weapon state that enriches uranium.”

We can no longer trust the Syrian regime. It is slaughtering us through murderous gangs. Urgent international assistance is called for


Hikmat Al-Hajri, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Syria, is publishing a particularly important proclamation today (a seminal proclamation in my opinion), following the murder of Druze in Syria in recent days in the Damascus and As-Sweida areas.
Al-Hajri declares that the Druze do not trust the existing regime, fear that they will be massacred as was done to the Alawites in the coastal cities, and demand urgent international assistance to prevent harm to them.
I am attaching a key quote from the proclamation that I think is important to me:
We no longer trust a body that claims to be a government.. because the government does not kill its people by means of its takfiri gangs to which it belongs, and after the massacres it claims to be fugitive elements.. and we do not trust the presence of its elements among us because they are just instruments of murder and bloodshed and kidnapping and falsifying facts, with a sectarian thinking that is takfiri for everyone
Translation:
We no longer trust the authority that calls itself a government. This is because a government does not murder its own people through infidel gangs that are affiliated with it and, after the massacres, claims that these are elements that have gotten out of control. We do not trust the presence of the people of this regime among us because they are nothing but murderous killing and kidnapping machines that falsify the facts, with a sectarian approach that considers other sects to be infidels.
##
Al-Hajiri touches here on the essence of the problem with the new regime. He uses his Sunni supporters, the ISIS gangs within him, to do the dirty work, and then claims with a wink that they are out of control...
Al-Hajri rightly mentions the events of the Alawite massacre, where the international community did nothing, and expresses a real fear that this is what will happen to the Druze, who did not start the recent riots but were attacked in their homes (the trigger for the attack on the Druze was an audio recording attributed to a Druze who insulted the Prophet Muhammad).
Abu Muhammad al-Julani, the president of Syria, is not giving up on his ambitions to conquer all of Syria, with the Sunni-Salafi approach on whose knees he grew up being a leading motif. He winks at the West in a suit and tie and unleashes his hounds to do the dirty work to dismantle centers of power and resistance in Syria with the goal of applying Sunni sovereignty to all of Syria.",

April 29 - Under the pretext of insulting the Prophet Muhammad (which turned out to be a complete lie), Islamist forces began to attack the Druze in Jaramana, a suburb southeast of the capital Damascus. After an exchange of fire, the Druze militias managed to drive the Islamist forces out of the town.
There were casualties among the Islamists and at least one Druze was killed.
Regime forces entered to restore order.

April 30 - Islamist forces rose at dawn to raid the town of Ashrafiyat Sahnaya, a suburb south of Damascus. The incident led to intense exchanges of fire between the Islamist and Druze militias. Which led to many deaths on both sides.
Towards noon, regime forces moved in to restore order and expel outside forces from the town, whether Druze or Islamist.
During the exchange of fire, Israeli drones carried out strikes against regime concentrations of forces, including against armored vehicles, which posed a threat to the Druze forces.

The Druze from Jabal a-Druz and Mount Hermon sent reinforcements to defend their positions in Damascus. The problem, of course, was the distance the forces needed to get into hostile territory. The northern part of the Druze settlement in Jabal a-Druz is at least 40 km from Sahnaya .

According to port regulations, the entry of highly hazardous materials such as ammonium nitrate — confirmed by experts to have been present at the explosion site — into Rajaei Port was strictly prohibited due to the extreme safety risks involved.

Nevertheless, as reported by Abbas Nejad, director of Rajaei Port, a ship flying the flag of an East Asian country (reportedly China) requested docking permission at 3:18 a.m.

During the inspection process, the ship’s captain refused access, stating that the ship’s owner had forbidden any cargo inspection.

Abbas Nejad further revealed that shortly after this refusal, he received a call from Hamidreza Aref — son of Vice President of Iran under President Pezeshkian .
Hamidreza Aref pressured him to authorize the ship’s docking without inspection, thereby enabling the entry of hazardous materials into the port.

Abbas Nejad reportedly replied that such a waiver could only be granted with the direct authorization of the Minister of Roads and Transportation.
In response, Hamidreza Aref threatened intervention, stating that if permission was not granted, his father — wielding high-level political influence — would personally intervene.

According to Abbas Nejad, during the unloading process, suspicious barrels — allegedly containing sensitive or hazardous material — were transferred into containers without any transparency or compliance with safety protocols.

Later communications indicated that the cargo was part of a sanctions evasion operation, and Hamidreza Aref allegedly stressed that no one should know the nature of the materials, as they were intended to be transferred onto another ship en route to a final destination.

53795,2025-04-30 05:07:41,-1001361890342,,,,"While Hamas fighters are not entitled to POW protections under the 3rd Geneva Convention, they are still protected under Common Article 3, which Israel upholds by treating detainees humanely.
Hamas, by contrast, continues to violate every basic principle of humanitarian law, including holding Israeli civilians and soldiers hostage under brutal conditions.
Conclusion:
Israel today is not only fighting a terrorist regime that has weaponized civilians — it is fighting a second war: a war against lies. From false claims of genocide, to manipulated casualty statistics, to the cynical misuse of humanitarian law, nearly every accusation leveled against Israel and the IDF distorts reality, ignores law, and inverts morality.
In Gaza, Israel faces a battlefield unlike any other in modern history: a dense, fortified, civilian-dominated urban environment deliberately and methodically turned into a human shield by Hamas. Yet despite these impossible conditions, Israel has conducted its campaign with a level of restraint, precision, and adherence to law that is virtually unmatched in modern warfare. It has taken more precautions to protect civilians than the law requires — often at great operational risk to its own forces.
But facts alone are not enough. They must be defended — clearly, forcefully, and repeatedly — against the tide of weaponized disinformation. The IDF's conduct is not a violation of international law; it is a defense of it. It is not a stain on the laws of war; it is a case study in how democratic nations must fight even when facing enemies who recognize no law, no morality, and no distinction between civilians and soldiers.
In a just world, Israel’s efforts would be recognized for what they are: the very definition of lawful and moral warfare. In the world we live in, however, defending these truths is not optional — it is essential.",
53794,2025-04-30 05:07:41,-1001361890342,,,,"75 million tons of aid, including humanitarian supplies, medicine and food, at a volume that in some periods has exceeded pre-war levels. In addition, Israel has also facilitated the supply of water and fuel, and even enabled the construction of numerous field hospitals.
The real cause of humanitarian suffering in Gaza is Hamas, which systematically hijacks and weaponizes aid for its fighters, attacks crossing points, and manipulates civilians as human shields.
Israel’s commitment to facilitating aid, even while its soldiers are under fire, is unparalleled in the history of warfare.
5. Lie: Israel indiscriminately attacks hospitals and schools.
International law protects hospitals, schools, and religious sites — but that protection is not absolute. If these facilities are used for military purposes — such as storing weapons, housing fighters, or command operations — they lose protected status.
Hamas has repeatedly, and systematically, turned Gaza’s hospitals into fortified military compounds and terrorist staging grounds, a grave violation of international humanitarian law.
At Al-Shifa Hospital, the IDF released evidence of a Hamas command center and underground tunnel network. At Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Israeli forces uncovered weapons, hostage-holding rooms, and operational centers. Similar violations were documented at Indonesian Hospital, Rantisi Hospital, and others.
Schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) have been used as rocket launching sites and weapons depots. In every instance, the IDF sought to verify intelligence, issue warnings, and minimize harm to civilians and medical personnel.
The outrage should not be directed at Israel for targeting legitimate military threats — but at Hamas, for systematically destroying the distinction between civilian and military space.
6. Lie: Israel is illegally occupying Gaza.
The assertion that Israel occupies Gaza is a misrepresentation of the current geopolitical reality. In 2005, Israel unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip, evacuating all Israeli civilians and military personnel, and dismantling its settlements. Since then, Hamas has maintained de facto control over Gaza, exercising both political and military authority.​
While Israel enforces a legitimate border control before October 7th and then a security cordon around Gaza after October 7th to prevent weapons smuggling and materials that could be used for terrorist activities or military operations, this measure is a lawful exercise of its right to self-defense, not an act of occupation. The blockade is implemented in coordination with Egypt and is subject to international scrutiny to ensure humanitarian needs are met.​
Claims of occupation often overlook the fact that Hamas, recognized as a terrorist organization by many countries, governs Gaza and is responsible for the well-being of its residents. Israel's military operations in Gaza are responses to ongoing security threats, including rocket attacks and tunnel infiltrations, and are conducted with the aim of neutralizing these threats while minimizing harm to civilians.​
In summary, the characterization of Israel as an occupying power in Gaza is inconsistent with the facts on the ground and the legal definitions under international law.​
7. Lie: Israel violates Hamas prisoners’ rights under the Geneva Conventions.
The 3rd Geneva Convention defines Prisoners of War (POWs) as combatants who meet four key conditions: being part of a recognized armed force, carrying arms openly, wearing a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, and conducting operations in accordance with the laws of war.
Hamas meet none of these standards. They hide among civilians, wear no uniforms, and routinely commit war crimes by targeting Israeli civilians, while shielding behind Palestinian ones, and embedding their combat operations within hospitals, schools, Mosques and residential areas.",
53793,2025-04-30 05:07:40,-1001361890342,,,,"One of the most dangerous and misleading claims is that civilian casualty figures alone prove Israel is committing war crimes. This is a fundamental distortion of international humanitarian law (IHL). Under the law of armed conflict, the legality of an attack is not judged by its outcome — such as the number of civilians killed — but by what commanders knew or reasonably could have known at the time of the attack. The legal test is proportionality: whether the expected incidental harm to civilians was excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.
War crimes are not assessed by after-the-fact body counts. They are judged by intent, the information available at the time, and whether all feasible precautions were taken to minimize civilian harm. Armchair statistics about civilian deaths, especially in an urban warzone, tell us nothing about the real-time decisions, legal standards, and battlefield conditions that define lawful conduct.
Moreover, the civilian casualty figures cited in the media are deeply unreliable. The so-called “Gaza Health Ministry,” run by Hamas, has a long track record of publishing inflated and unverifiable numbers. Independent reviews have shown that its counts include combatants among civilian tallies, double-count deaths, and list names that cannot be independently confirmed. In many cases, their reports have even included civilians killed by Hamas’s own misfired rockets. These are not neutral casualty assessments — they are information warfare, used by a terrorist organization engaged in a global campaign to delegitimize Israel.
Even if it were somehow possible to determine the exact ratio of civilians to combatants killed — which it is not in the midst of a dynamic urban war — the claim would still be legally and morally meaningless. Hamas fighters deliberately operate without uniforms or insignia and embed themselves within civilian areas. They store weapons in schools, launch attacks from hospitals, and use ambulances to transport fighters. Many fighters are indistinguishable from civilians, including minors recruited or coerced into service. It is legally incorrect to treat all women or anyone under 18 as civilians. Hamas trains and deploys child soldiers, blurring lines even further.
As I have shown in my research, even if we compared the entirety of Gaza to a single urban battle — such as the Battle of Mosul (2016–2017), where U.S. and Iraqi forces fought ISIS in a densely populated city — Gaza’s civilian casualty ratio would be comparable or even lower. But this entire framework is wrong. Civilian-to-combatant ratios without context are not how wars, military operations, or individual strikes are judged — legally, morally, or ethically. What matters under the law is whether a commander took all feasible precautions, targeted a legitimate military objective, and ensured the expected civilian harm was not excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage.
To demonstrate the absurdity of this casualty-based framework, consider the Korean War (1950–1953), during which an estimated 2 million civilians died. Over a 37-month conflict, this averages more than 54,000 civilian deaths per month. Using those figures — without context, cause, or operational detail — to make moral or legal judgments about the conduct of that war would be nonsensical. And yet, that is exactly the logic being applied to Israel.
This is not, and cannot be, how war is judged. If raw casualty ratios were the sole metric of legality, no democracy could ever defend itself against an enemy that fights from within a civilian population. That is not justice — it is surrender by legal distortion.
4. Lie: Israel is starving Gaza’s population.
The accusation that Israel uses starvation as a weapon is flatly contradicted by facts on the ground — and by the sheer scale of humanitarian aid Israel facilitates even during wartime.
Since October 7, according to COGAT (the Israeli government body coordinating humanitarian operations), almost 100,000 trucks have entered Gaza carrying 1.",

By John Spencer & Arsen Ostrovsky

In an era of weaponized disinformation, few militaries have been more vilified — or more wrongly accused — than the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Israel’s war against Hamas has been distorted beyond recognition by activists, media outlets, and even some international institutions.
It is time to confront the truth head-on. Here are the seven most pervasive lies — and the reality they seek to obscure.
1. Lie: Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.
Genocide is the most serious crime under international law, defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention as acts committed with ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group."" Crucially, genocide requires specific intent — not simply that civilian deaths occur during war, but that they are intended as part of a broader plan to exterminate a people. This specific intent — known in legal terms as dolus specialis — sets a uniquely high bar that distinguishes genocide from even the most destructive military actions.
The acts that could constitute genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention include killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births; and forcibly transferring children to another group. Crucially, however, these acts only amount to genocide when committed with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group as such.
None of Israel's actions meet this threshold. Israel targets Hamas — an armed terrorist entity that initiated the war with mass atrocities on October 7. The IDF issues evacuation warnings, facilitates humanitarian aid, and restricts military operations to lawful targets. There is no Israeli policy, order, or pattern of action that suggests an attempt to destroy the Palestinian people.
Even the International Court of Justice (ICJ), despite accepting a politically driven genocide claim for preliminary hearings, has not ruled that Israel is committing genocide — nor has any credible international body. Israel's conduct is the very opposite of genocide: it is a defensive war waged under the binding requirements of international law.
2. Lie: Israel intentionally targets civilians in Gaza.
Under international humanitarian law, the presence of civilian casualties in war — while tragic — does not equate to a war crime unless civilians are directly and intentionally targeted.
The IDF is one of the only militaries in history to systematically exceed the legal obligations to protect civilians. Israel’s methods include:
-  Advance warnings through leaflets, SMS texts, phone calls, providing their military maps to civilians, and even “roof-knock” warning munitions before strikes.
-  Establishing humanitarian evacuation corridors.
-  Constant aerial surveillance to abort missions if civilians are detected near targets.
-  Use of precision-guided munitions to minimize explosive radius.
-  Use of “call out” tactics to surround areas or buildings, call all personnel out, and then using facial recognition to identify Hamas militants within the crowds.
-  Frequent cancellation of planned attacks when civilian presence is deemed too high — even at significant operational cost. In fact, Israel routinely refrains from striking legitimate military targets because of the potential for civilian casualties.
As documented in multiple cases during the current conflict, Israeli forces have walked away from critical high-value targets — senior Hamas commanders — simply because women and children were nearby. No army in the world holds fire to the degree Israel does in the face of an enemy that embeds itself inside a civilian population.
3. Lie: The civilian-to-combatant ratio in Gaza proves Israel is committing war crimes.",

Students had to DENOUNCE ISRAEL just to be accepted. If you didn’t reject the Jewish state, you weren’t “one of the good ones.” PURE antisemitic gatekeeping.

Professors and students RESURRECTED an antisemitic cartoon so vile, it was condemned by Black civil rights heroes in the 1960s. And they proudly reposted it in 2024.

Jewish students were told they’re GUILTY of ‘atrocities’ just for being Jewish. Study abroad programs made them confess sins they never committed. This is cult-level abuse.

Israelis (JEWS, MUSLIMS, AND CHRISTIANS), were SHUNNED. If you were Israeli, they didn’t care who you were, you were the ENEMY. Period.

Harvard admits it’s TEACHING antisemitism. Curriculum packed with one-sided anti-Israel propaganda. They weren’t just tolerating hate, they were assigning it.

Pro-Palestinian activism devolved into TOTAL SOCIAL EXCLUSION and open calls to DESTROY ISRAEL. Not activism. HATE MOVEMENT.

Jewish students were dragged through the identity politics mud. Told they had “extra privilege” because they were Jewish, even if they were working class or first gen.

Harvard HELPED radicalize students instead of promoting tolerance. They fed them a steady diet of hate and called it “education.”

This isn’t “isolated incidents.” This is a DELIBERATE, SYSTEMIC, CULTURE OF HATE.

Since October 7th, the soldiers of the elite Moran Reserves Unit have spent over 200 days in active reserve duty—and we're about to be called up again, with no clear end in sight. Moran is a highly mobile and dynamic unit, operating from makeshift outposts rather than secure army bases. In these exposed conditions, we must be ready at any moment to respond to attacks and quickly mobilize classified weapons systems critical to Israel’s defense.

Recently, we have been operating in northern Israel, near Mount Hermon and along the Syrian border, where the terrain is harsh, the weather is cold, and the threats are constant.

While the army provides some supplies, the realities of our mission—constantly moving through rugged, hostile environments—mean that we often lack essential gear. Warm, durable clothing is vital to withstand the freezing northern nights. Better protective equipment, like lighter helmets and improved shrapnel vests, allow us to move faster, endure longer, and survive the increasing threats of mortars and drones. Even small upgrades—more camouflage netting, stronger vehicle protection, or proper field gear—can save lives and make our missions more effective.

Your donation goes directly to keeping these soldiers safe, effective, and ready. Every contribution—no matter the size—helps protect the men who are protecting Israel and the Jewish people. Thank you for standing with them.",

Last Thursday, in Gaza City, the IDF and ISA eliminated Ali Naddal Husni Sarfiti, a terrorist in the Palestinian Popular Front terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip. 
Sarfiti served a consecutive sentence in Israel between the years of 2002 and 2015 for conducting terrorist activity for the Palestinian Popular Front terrorist organization, providing military training, and planning a suicide bombing attack in Israel. 

After his release, he operated in recent years to carry out terrorist attacks in Israeli territory. Investigations revealed that he maintained contact with terrorists in Judea and Samaria and transferred millions of shekels in terror funds to support the establishment of terrorist infrastructure and the execution of terror attacks.

Additionally, in other IDF and ISA strikes, the following terrorists were eliminated: 

Saʿid Abu Hasnan, Hamas Nukbha terrorist in the Deir Al Balah Brigade who infiltrated and took part in the massacre in Kissufim on October 7th. 

Mustafa al-Mutawwak, an operations officer in Hamas' Jabalia Brigade who directed terrorist attacks against IDF troops in the Gaza Strip, was eliminated.

Tomorrow (Tuesday) evening we will mark Memorial Day for the fallen in Israel's armed forces and victims of hostilities. We will bow our heads in memory of the fallen and the victims of terrorism, and the flags will be lowered to half-mast.
Silence sirens will be heard across the country on Tuesday at 8:00 PM and on Wednesday at 11:00 AM.

According to data from the Ministry of Defense, since the establishment of the state in 1948 until 2025, the number of Israeli servicemen killed in action stands at approximately 24,981. In the past year, 317 were added. Fallen, most of them in the ""Iron Swords"" war that began on October 7, 2023 and continues to this day.
716 people died in the war – including 642 IDF soldiers, 39 members of emergency squads, 68 police officers and 6 Shin Bet personnel.

Since the establishment of the state, 4,070 civilians have been murdered in hostilities, of which 740 were children and teenagers under the age of 18.
Today, there are 8,674 bereaved parents, 5,391 widows, 10,302 orphans, and 34,250 bereaved brothers and sisters – a total of about 58,617 bereaved family members, with about 10% of them added since the October 7th.

The transition from Memorial Day to Independence Day will be marked by the state torchlight ceremony on Mount Herzl, symbolizing the connection between the sacrifice of the fallen and the freedom of the country.
Memorial Day allows Israeli society to unite in pain and pride, while recognizing the heavy price paid for our existence.

However, the proximity between Memorial Day and Independence Day continues to stir controversy – between those who see it as a living expression of the inseparable connection between bereavement and rebirth, and those who seek to separate and honor each of the days separately.
Supporters claim that the sharp transition illustrates the meaning of freedom born of sacrifice, while opponents believe that it makes it difficult to process grief and harms the dignity of memory.

Either way, the great pain of the loss touches all corners of Israeli society.
And between the sirens of silence and the flags lowered to half-mast - the people of Israel will unite with the memory of the fallen and will not forget the most precious price paid for its freedom.",

Hanan Gefen said this morning on Israel This Morning that allowing the murderous terrorist organization Hamas to remain in the Gaza Strip is a disaster for the State of Israel. This statement comes amid the ongoing stalemate in Gaza and criticism directed at the political echelon for conducting the fighting without a strategic decision. He also outlined how Israel is enabling Qatar to return to the center of the regional stage and promote solutions that ensure Hamas’s survival.

Gefen addressed Qatar’s involvement in negotiations regarding the future of Gaza, noting that in March, Qatar led an American understanding that Hamas would remain in Gaza for a limited period of five years. According to him, “This issue was supposedly behind us, as Adam Boehler was ousted, and Marco Rubio said it would not happen again.”

He pointed out that a week ago, Qatar’s prime minister visited the United States and met with President Donald Trump, with one of the main topics of discussion being Hamas’s continued presence in Gaza—a situation Israel cannot allow to persist. Immediately after the meeting, a conversation took place between Trump and Israel’s prime minister, followed by a trip by the head of the Mossad to meet with Qatar’s prime minister. Gefen said: “I assume Trump told Netanyahu something like, ‘Bibi, go meet this guy in Qatar, he has something to tell you.’”

The Middle East expert emphasized that while Israel focuses on the release of hostages, Qatar’s primary concern is ensuring Hamas’s continued presence in Gaza. “Until a few months ago, Qatar was talking about the hostages, and the issue of Hamas was on the sidelines. Today, Hamas’s survival has become their central focus, and they’re no longer hiding it,” he said. He warned that Qatar’s return to the scene is “not a good event” for Israel.

According to Gefen, Trump likely instructed Israel to listen to Qatar’s proposals, which offer a “creative solution” that includes the continuation of Hamas’s rule, even if not formally. “For Israel, this issue is a taboo,” Gefen stressed. “If Hamas remains in Gaza, it’s a disaster for the State of Israel for many years to come.”

He predicted that within a week or two, there will be a “point of collision” between Israel and the U.S. administration, including President Trump and his team. He noted that the Qataris continue to be active across the Middle East, including providing financial aid to regimes like Syria, exploiting U.S. sanctions that prevent aid from other sources.

The brigadier general explained that Qatar continues to position itself as a central player in the Middle East, partly by funding regimes facing economic difficulties. He noted that the Qatari prime minister’s visit to the U.S. included discussions about obtaining American approval for financial aid to Syria, such as funding salaries. “The Americans see Qatar as a partner,” he said, adding that its renewed involvement in Gaza affairs is particularly concerning.

Flammable chemicals usually ignite in a single spot and do not cause multiple simultaneous explosions in different places.

The containers were 'tampered with' in the country of origin, during transport, or by local agents in Iran.

It contains the earliest undisputed extra-biblical reference to Israel to date.

The mention of Israel in this 3,200-year-old document suggests, at the time of its inscription, the nation of Israel was an established power and not a nomadic people who had just recently entered the land of Canaan. Before the discovery of the stele, many dated the Exodus much later, but now they are forced to reconcile with the fact that Israel was already an established power in Canaan in 1207BC.
Merneptah was the 13th son of Ramesses ii. Although his life was overshadowed by his father, many Egyptologists suggest that Merneptah was both a co-ruler and the real power behind the throne in the last few years of Ramesses’s life.
His military campaigns are recorded on three separate ancient inscriptions, with the Victory Stele of Merneptah as one of them.
With 25 readable lines written in hieroglyphics, the inscription recounts Merneptah’s conquests of the land of Canaan. Part of the inscription reads:

Canaan is captive with all woe.

Ashkelon is conquered, Gezer seized,

Yanoam made nonexistent;

Israel is laid waste, bare of seed,

Israel, then, must have been a people strong enough for Merneptah to mention them in boasting of his victory. If Israel was some small nomadic tribe just beginning to settle in Canaan, Merneptah wouldn’t have had anything to boast about. Alternatively, if Israel had been established for 200 years, built its own structures and had a stronger military, then his victory would be worth mentioning.

Not a day passes without me wanting, in my flesh, to walk away from news reporting, yet I never receive confirmation in my spirit to do so. If anything, the flood of fake news, sensationalism, and garbage I see online—across Christian, Jewish, and secular circles—convinces me more that what I really need is help and support rather than to walk away.

So, would you please pray for me to have the strength, support, and wisdom to not only seek help but also to embrace it when I find it?

I want to thank you for allowing me to be part of your life’s journey. All I ask is that you not take it for granted but remember that behind this huge channel—the largest news channel from Israel—there is a person who is incredibly busy with a million and a half other things and truly needs your prayers.

He is essentially hinting through the story: Even if he himself now chooses to negotiate with the Americans – perhaps even sign an agreement – ​​this is only a temporary move. The ultimate goal, he says, has not changed: overthrowing the West, destroying Israel, and leading a global revolution – which will soon be realized.

In accordance with Shiite tradition, he argued that if one wants the global revolution and the establishment of a world government of Shiite Islam to be realized, then one must be silent and not talk about the actions being taken to achieve this goal – including the development of nuclear weapons. In the time of Jafar Sadiq, he said, people talked too much – and therefore God’s will was not fulfilled.

In doing so, he implicitly criticized recent public talk by Iranian officials about nuclear weapons, and made it clear that a low profile was needed. “The real things are done quietly,” he said, reinforcing the idea that this was a deeply held Shiite belief – quiet, slow, determined action – that would bring about “Islamic redemption.”

At the end of his speech, he brought up a story and vehemently denied it – according to which Imam Ja'far Sadiq surrendered to the Caliph. ""This is a complete lie,"" he said. ""The Shiite Imam will never surrender. Even if he dies, even if all his family members die – he will not bow down to the enemies of God.""
In other words: If the Americans demand to eliminate the nuclear program, stop funding the proxies, or eliminate the missile program – Iran will not give up. On the contrary – it will go all the way, because resistance is the only way to realize the Shiite vision.

The conclusion:
His speech was not merely “religious.” It was a call for direction. Every hint, every story, every historical reminder – were intended to convey a clear message: Even if there is a truce, even if an agreement is signed, even if Iran lowers its profile – the goal has not changed. Iran sees itself on a historical mission – and anyone who tries to understand its policy through the prism of short-term interests or Western rationality – is simply missing the point.

""First of all, they must stop their intervention in Syria, stop the bombings, and withdraw from the Syrian territories they entered. Then we can talk about an agreement with Israel. All the countries that are signatories to this (Abraham) agreement - Israel is not occupying territory for them.""

The Holocaust teaches a fundamental strategic lesson: Some forms of evil must be completely defeated and eradicated. Even if a partial victory could neutralize the threat and save lives, certain ideologies are so dangerous that they must not be allowed to persist in any governing state.

In World War II, Western Allies lost approximately 70,000 soldiers in battles on German soil, while the Soviets lost 80,000 in the Berlin campaign alone. These 150,000 soldiers might have survived had the Allies accepted a peace treaty that left Germany demilitarized, diminished, and defeated. Such an agreement would have required only one concession: allowing the Nazi state to continue existing. This could have secured a superficial peace, but the Allies rejected it.

At the war’s end, the Nazi regime was willing to negotiate such a ""surrender,"" but the Allies refused. They understood that the Nazi state’s survival, in any form, was unacceptable. To achieve its complete destruction, Allied leaders were prepared to sacrifice 150,000 soldiers’ lives—a decision that also prolonged suffering for German civilians.

This lesson applies even more urgently to the Hamas-controlled state in Gaza.

Hamas’s regime in Gaza surpasses Nazi Germany in its extremism. Its ideology, rooted in violence and intolerance, enjoys significant support among Gaza’s population, arguably exceeding the support for Nazism in Germany. Hamas’s actions, such as the Simchat Torah attack, reflect a reckless and destructive fanaticism that outstrips even the Nazis’ calculated aggression. If World War II was a brutal but strategic endeavor, Hamas’s attacks are dangerously irrational by comparison.

If Nazi Germany’s survival was unthinkable, the continued existence of Hamas’s regime in Gaza is equally unacceptable. It must be completely dismantled as a governing entity. No other outcome can legitimately end our conflict with this regime.

India announces strong measures against Pakistan following yesterday’s deadly terror attack against Hindu tourists (26 killed) by Islamist terrorists from Pakistan:

1. Cancelling visas for all Pakistanis
2. Suspends Indus Waters Treaty (1960)
3. Closes the Wagah border crossing

- Pakistan has previously stated that terminating the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) could amount to an act of war.

The World Bank-brokered agreement allocates the waters of 6 rivers in the Indus Basin. 

India controls the eastern rivers (Sutlej, Beas, Ravi) with unrestricted use, while Pakistan has primary rights over the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab), though India can use them for non-consumptive purposes like hydropower. 

If India starts blocking access to water from all 6 rivers, Pakistan will be hit by a water scarcity crisis and its economy will be in serious trouble as 70% of Pakistan’s water needs are covered by these rivers.

Pakistan’s Punjab and Sindh provinces, key agricultural hubs, would face severe water shortages followed by reduced crop yields, food insecurity, and economic losses. 

- The Wagah border crossing, near Amritsar (India) and Lahore (Pakistan), is a key trade and cultural link, famous for its daily flag-lowering ceremony. Closing the vital trade route will particularly impact trade in agricultural products and cement. 

Pakistan will instead have to rely on costlier routes via third countries or ports, increasing import costs and inflation. The Lahore region will face immediate economic hardship, unemployment and potential social unrest.

The IDF, in cooperation with the ISA, carried out a targeted strike overnight on approximately 40 engineering vehicles used for terror purposes, including during the October 7th massacre.
The engineering vehicles were also used for terror purposes against IDF troops during the fighting in the Gaza Strip.

The engineering vehicles that were targeted are a central component in Hamas' ability to carry out terror operations against IDF troops and the State of Israel.
During the murderous massacre on October 7th, the engineering unit of Hamas, which was responsible for breaching the security barrier between Israel and the Gaza Strip, used engineering vehicles to enable the passage of armed terrorists in trucks and on motorcycles into Israeli territory. During the October 7th massacre, dozens of breaches were made using engineering vehicles, including the construction of improvised bridges and the planting of explosives to break through the security barrier.

Al-Jamaa al-Islamiya, also known as the Islamic Group, is a Sunni Islamist political party in Lebanon, established in 1964 as the Lebanese branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Its military arm, the al-Fajr Forces, has been involved in launching attacks against Israel, frequently in coordination with Hamas.

As for armed groups in Lebanon, here are the main militias and terrorist-designated organizations:

1️⃣ Hezbollah
2️⃣ Hamas
3️⃣ Palestinian Factions: Groups like Fatah, PFLP, DFLP, Osbat al-Ansar, and others operate inside refugee camps.
4️⃣ Al-Jamaa al-Islamiya (Islamic Group)
5️⃣ Islamic State (ISIS) Cells: Small pockets of ISIS-affiliated cells, mostly in border regions or uncovered in raids.
6️⃣ Al-Qaeda/HTS Affiliates: Occasionally present through splinter factions or individuals, especially in the past near the Syrian border.

So, Lebanon currently harbors at least 6 types of armed factions or militias, with most of them considered terrorist organizations by the international community.

As part of this effort, he collaborated with Iranian operatives to facilitate the transfer of weapons and funds into Lebanon, including through the Beirut International Airport. 

Nasr maintained contact with employees of the airport who secretly operate for Hezbollah and assist with smuggling operations.

Moreover, he oversaw the terrorist organizations' reinforcement and military build-up process.

“Well for the Europeans they have an important decision to make very soon on the snapback of sanctions because Iran is clearly out of compliance with the current deal,” Rubio said.

“As you saw, the IAEA was in Tehran yesterday, uh, issued public statements saying Iran is as close as it's ever been to nuclear weapons,” he added.

“The president's made clear Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. That is not going to happen.”

“We're hoping that talks continue and that they're fruitful and that they can lead to something. We would all prefer a peaceful resolution and a lasting one,” Rubio said.

“It has to be something that actually not just prevents Iran from having a nuclear weapon now, but in the future as well — not just for 10 years with some sort of sunset provision or the like.”

“So we discussed that obviously because the Europeans, the E3, have a decision to make on snapback.”

“I believe we should all anticipate, based on the public comments yesterday, that they're about to get a report from the IAEA that says not just is Iran out of compliance, but Iran is dangerously close to a weapon — closer than they've ever been.”

“They're going to have to make a decision about whether they want to reimpose these sanctions. And, uh, you know, if Iran is out of compliance, they have to reimpose the sanctions.”

“So that's going to be a factor in all this. And that's why it was important we talked to them about it before our talks on Saturday.”",

But the legal standards do not change. Every action must meet the test of military necessity. Every strike must be tied to a legitimate objective. The presence of civilians demands restraint, even when facing an adversary that deliberately exploits them.
Necessary War, Constrained Conduct
So, was Israel’s war against Hamas necessary?
That depends on which kind of necessity you mean. But in truth, it meets both tests:
Was the war morally necessary? After October 7th—following the deliberate massacre of civilians, the kidnapping of hostages, and Hamas’s declared intention to repeat those atrocities—the answer is unequivocally yes.
Are Israel’s military operations legally necessary? While each strike must meet specific legal thresholds, the IDF operates under one of the most stringent legal and ethical frameworks in modern warfare. It is bound by the law of armed conflict and has demonstrated an unprecedented commitment to minimizing harm, even while engaging an enemy that hides among civilians and violates every rule of war.
A war can be both morally justified and legally constrained. Israel’s campaign against Hamas is exactly that. It was not launched lightly or recklessly—it was waged in defense of life, sovereignty, and the rule of law.
Anyone asking whether Israel’s war was necessary should first understand what they are really asking—and then recognize that the answer, by every standard that matters, is yes.",
53258,2025-04-18 03:28:02,-1001361890342,,,,"Why Israel’s War Against Hamas Is Necessary

By John Spencer and Arsen Ostrovsky


Following Hamas's barbaric October 7th massacre—which killed over 1,200 people in Israel, most of them civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, with over 250 taken hostage—Israel launched a large-scale military campaign in Gaza. The scope and intensity of the response were unprecedented, but so too was the attack that prompted it.
Since then, there has been no shortage of uninformed actors, like comedian Dave Smith, or malign parties weaponizing international law to question whether Israel’s military actions in Gaza have been proportionate, lawful, and ultimately—whether even necessary.
At the heart of that last question lies a critical misunderstanding. ""Necessity"" in war has two distinct meanings and conflating them—morally and legally—leads to flawed assessments and misleading narratives.
Two Necessities: One Moral, One Legal
1. Moral Necessity – The Just War Tradition
The first concept of necessity comes from just war theory, an ethical framework developed over centuries to evaluate whether the use of force can be morally justified (jus ad bellum).
One of its core tenets is necessity:
War must be a last resort, undertaken only after all nonviolent alternatives—diplomacy, deterrence, sanctions, international mediation—have been exhausted.
In the case of Israel, the record speaks for itself. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, dismantling all civilian and military infrastructure. In the years that followed, Hamas seized power in a violent coup, launched tens of thousands of rockets, and rejected every meaningful effort at peaceful coexistence. Despite periodic ceasefires and repeated international mediation, Hamas remained committed not to a Palestinian state alongside Israel—but to Israel’s destruction.
On October 7th, Hamas made its intentions unmistakable. It crossed the border not to challenge Israeli soldiers, but to massacre civilians. It filmed the atrocities and vowed to do it again. In that context, the claim that Israel’s military response lacked moral necessity ignores the facts and defies common sense.
2. Legal Necessity – The Law of Armed Conflict
The second form of necessity is not philosophical but legal. It belongs to the realm of international humanitarian law (IHL)—the rules governing the conduct of war (jus in bello).
Military necessity permits only those actions required to achieve a legitimate military objective.
This principle—codified in the Geneva Conventions, Hague Regulations, and customary international law—does not allow destruction for its own sake. It does not excuse harm to civilians unless it is incidental to a lawful strike. And it certainly does not override the obligations to distinguish between military and civilian targets or to avoid disproportionate attacks.
Every Israeli military operation in Gaza is bound by this standard. It is not enough to identify a Hamas presence in a building or a neighborhood. To strike lawfully, the target must provide a concrete and direct military advantage, and every feasible precaution must be taken to mitigate civilian harm.
Israel’s military attorneys and commanders operate within this framework. Target selection, weapon choice, timing of attack, and warning mechanisms are scrutinized in real time. The IDF not only operates under legal necessity—it documents and reviews its actions at a level few modern militaries do, particularly when fighting a terrorist group embedded in a civilian population.
The Bridge vs. the Bakery
A useful example from the laws of war helps clarify this distinction.
Destroying a bridge used to transport enemy weapons is a lawful act of military necessity. It offers a clear operational advantage and directly degrades enemy capability. By contrast, destroying a bakery in a residential neighborhood simply because enemy fighters may stop there for food is not. The bakery is not a military objective, and its destruction would serve no legitimate military purpose.
This distinction matters in urban warfare.",

Destruction of Houthi Controlled Ras Isa Fuel Port

The Houthis have continued to benefit economically and militarily from countries and companies that provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. The Iran-backed Houthis use fuel to sustain their military operations, as a weapon of control, and to benefit economically from embezzling the profits from the import. This fuel should be legitimately supplied to the people of Yemen. Despite the Foreign Terrorist Designation that went into effect on 05 April, ships have continued to supply fuel via the port of Ras Isa. Profits from these illegal sales are directly funding and sustaining Houthi terrorist efforts.

Today, US forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years. The objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen. This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.

Israel planned to carry out a large-scale bombing campaign from the air, and then to land commando forces on the ground to severely damage and dismantle the nuclear facilities on the ground. However, it was estimated that the operation that includes commando forces, would not be ready before October, and Israel wanted to act quickly. One reason for the rapid action was the desire to carry out the operation before the commander of CENTCOM, General Michael Erik Kurilla, leaves his post. The new plan, without commandos, proposed that Israel, with US support and assistance, would bomb Iran's nuclear facilities for an entire week, while defending against a large-scale missile attack.

Israel had planned to strike Iranian nuclear sites as early as next month, but President Donald Trump has halted the plan in recent weeks in favor of negotiating a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program, according to U.S. administration officials and others familiar with the discussions.

Trump made his decision after months of internal debate over whether to pursue diplomacy or support Israel in its effort to weaken Iran’s ability to build a nuclear bomb at a time when Tehran’s military and economic power has declined.

The dispute has highlighted divisions between U.S. officials known for their historical hawkish views and other advisers who are more skeptical about the ability of military strikes to eliminate Iran’s nuclear ambitions without triggering a wider war. 

The discussion has produced a rough consensus, for now, against military action, with indications from Iran that it is willing to negotiate.

Israeli officials have recently formulated plans to attack Iranian nuclear sites in May and have been prepared to carry them out, and have even expressed optimism at times that the United States would give its approval. 

According to sources briefed on these proposals, the goal was to slow Tehran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons by a year or more.

Implementing most of these plans would require American assistance, not only to protect Israel from any Iranian response but also to ensure the success of the Israeli attack, making the United States a central part of the operation itself.

Trump has chosen diplomacy over military action for now. In his first term, he withdrew from the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran, but in his second term, in an attempt to avoid a new Middle East war, he began negotiations with Tehran, giving it no more than a few months to reach an agreement on its nuclear program.

Trump informed Israel earlier this month of his decision that the United States would not support a military strike. He discussed the matter with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Washington last week, where he announced in an Oval Office meeting that the United States had begun talks with Iran. 

Netanyahu said in a statement delivered in Hebrew after the meeting that any agreement with Iran would not succeed unless the signatories were allowed “to go in, bomb the facilities, and dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision and enforcement.” 

This report is based on conversations with several officials briefed on secret Israeli military plans and confidential discussions within the Trump administration. Most of the interviewees spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military planning.

Israel has long planned to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, conducting bombing drills and calculating the extent of the damage it could inflict with or without American assistance.

Support for the Israeli government to strike has grown after a series of setbacks suffered by Iran last year.

Most of Iran’s ballistic missiles failed to penetrate U.S. and Israeli defenses in Iran’s attacks on Israel in April, and Hezbollah, Iran’s main ally, was dealt a devastating blow in an Israeli military campaign last year. The subsequent fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria eliminated an ally of Iran and Hezbollah and cut off a major route for arms smuggling from Iran.

Air defense systems in Iran and Syria were also destroyed, along with facilities used by Iran to produce rocket fuel, crippling the country’s ability to produce new missiles for a period of time.

At Netanyahu’s request, senior Israeli officials briefed their American counterparts on a plan that combined an Israeli commando operation against underground nuclear sites with an airstrike campaign, a plan in which the Israelis hoped American aircraft would participate.

But Israeli military officials said the special operation would not be ready until October, while Netanyahu wanted it to be implemented more quickly.",

In that infiltration incident, Nukhba terrorists infiltrated into Israel via a terror tunnel toward a guard post in the Nahal Oz area, injured an IDF soldier, and killed five additional IDF soldiers - Sergeant Daniel Kedmi, Sergeant Barkai Ishai Shor, Sergeant Erez Sagi, Sergeant Dor Deri, and Sergeant Nadav Raymond.

The IDF and ISA will continue to operate to locate and eliminate terrorists in order to remove any threat posed to Israeli civilians.",

Overnight (Sunday), the IDF struck a command and control center that served as a terror infrastructure for terrorists in the area of Daraj Tuffah. The compound contained a weapons storage facility where explosives devices were located that were used by Hamas terrorists to carry out terror attacks against IDF troops.

Over the 48 hours, the IAF struck over 90 terror targets belonging to terrorist organizations throughout the Gaza Strip. Among the targets struck, was the infrastructure from which projectiles were launched yesterday (Saturday). Additionally, the IAF struck weapons storage facilities, terrorist cells, and terrorist infrastructure.

IDF troops continue to operate in the area of Rafah and on the ""Morag"" Corridor. As part of the operation, the troops eliminated terrorists and struck Hamas terrorist infrastructure.

In the areas of Tel Al-Sultan and al-Shaboura, IDF troops located and dismantled weapons, terrorist infrastructure, and tunnel shafts.

In northern Gaza, IDF troops struck and dismantled terrorist infrastructure and tunnel shafts, and eliminated during an airstrike several terrorists who attempted to plant an explosive device in the ground.",
53062,2025-04-13 12:34:37,-1001361890342,,,,"Overnight, the IDF was forced to conduct a military operation within the Al Ahli Hospital in northern Gaza.

Conducting such military operations in war time, is very grave matter. But what does int’l law say about this, and when do hospitals become legitimate military targets?

Under International Humanitarian Law, it is a foundational principle that hospitals receive special protected status. See for example, Art. 18 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Art. 8 of the Rome Statute, as well as customary int’l law.

However, the laws of armed conflict are also pragmatic enough to recognize there are exceptional circumstances in times of war, in which hospitals may lose such special status.

In short, this protection ceases if hospitals are “used to commit hostile acts” or for military purposes.

See specifically Art. 8(2) of the Rome Statute, Art. 19 of the 4th Geneva Convention or Art. 11 of the 2nd Protocol to the Geneva Conventions.

In this case, intelligence indicated the Al Ahli hospital compound was being used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers, therefore causing the hospital to lose its protected status and turning it into a legitimate military target.

We know, as an indispensable fact now, that Hamas systematically embeds their operations and terrorist fighters in hospitals, using civilians as human shields and hospitals as their command centers.

However, merely because Hamas has seized hospitals as its own personal launching pads, does not provide carte blanche for Israel to conduct military operations. Under humanitarian law, Israel must still abide by fundamental rules such as distinction, proportionality and precaution. In each case, it has acted in accordance with its obligation. 

Israel also took ample precaution, including providing advanced warning and helping facilitate the evacuation of civilians, staff and patients.

The IDF also used precision weapons, in order to mitigate any potential harm to civilians or to the hospital compound.

Quite simply, Israel has gone to unprecedented lengths to comply with its obligations pursuant to the law of armed conflict, whereas Hamas is doing everything possible in order to violate those laws and maximize casualties.

It should also be noted that Al Ahli is the same hospital that on October 17th, 2023, Islamic Jihad fired a missle and then accused Israel for it - which the int’l community and press immediately rushed to blindly parrot.

Those who truly care about the wellbeing of civilians in Gaza, and who are rightfully aghast at the scenes coming out of Al Alhi Hospital would be well advised to direct their outrage at Hamas, which continues to unconscionably and illegally turn hospitals into their personal control and command centers and severely risk the lives of innocent civilians.

Because the Iranian regime is weaker and fearful more than ever, And - this could also be one of the greatest diplomatic deception operations we’ve seen.

Khamenei is at the weakest point of his rule since assuming power in June 1989. In his recent public appearances, he has appeared pale and dejected - especially when compared to the early months following October 7.  It’s no surprise. His life’s work, the network of Iranian proxy militias - has suffered a major blow: operationally, geopolitically and strategically. Billions of dollars of Iranian public funds have gone to waste. 
But beyond that, the Iranian people as a whole are in a dire situation - one that threatens domestic stability and risks sparking a wide-scale uprising that could endanger the regime’s survival. Alongside severe repression, human rights violations, and mass executions, Iran today faces a reality with no clean water, no electricity, no gas, no clean air, and no money. The economy is in ruins, the currency is at a historic low, and over one-third of the population lives below the poverty line Khamenei does not want to be remembered as the leader under whose watch the regime collapsed. When the house is burning, you do whatever it takes to save yourself first - even if it means humiliating yourself before your greatest enemy. And naturally, this is the perfect moment for the Shia concept of Taqiyya - deception and dishonesty for the sake of self-preservation and advancing one’s interests. It would be naïve to believe they are abandoning their ideology or plans. 
Can a Persian leopard change its spots? They are stalling for time because they know there won’t be another Donald Trump. They are the children of hardship and the Ramadan. Difficulty is no stranger to them. And the regime still has oil, gold, and crypto in abundance to keep its head above water and continue repressing dissent.

There’s no point in viewing this situation through a lens of rationality. “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” aren’t just slogans - it’s their raison d'etre and a pure Ideology. The regime wants to survive - but it also wants to destroy Israel, and it has been working on that since the day it was founded. It seeks to spread Shia Islam into moderate Sunni nations, and for years it has been working to create chaos in those societies. An agreement at this moment would be a historic lifeline to a regime at its weakest point ever - and a crushing blow to the Iranian people and to the Middle East.

It’s very clear: as long as this regime stands, there will never be peace in the Middle East.

The same army that received drones from Iran and handed over control of Sudan’s port to China (because apparently, national sovereignty is overrated) is now eyeing the rest of Africa as a dumping ground for their knockoff destruction, cheap goods, deadly results.

Here’s the punchline: the Sudanese army is being led by Omar al-Bashir and Ahmed Haroun, both indicted war criminals by the ICC, both with blood on their hands, both Islamist terrorists who orchestrated genocide and murdered over half a million people. These two clowns are not in hiding; they’re running the army and the foreign ministry, like it’s some twisted comedy.

Interestingly enough, Intelligence information obtained by ""Iran International"" revealed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard sent a weapons shipment to Sudan on March 17th via a cargo plane belonging to ""Fars Air Qeshm,"" a company under international sanctions. The plane, a Boeing 747 with the registration code ""EP-FAB,"" took off from Tehran to Port Sudan, delivering the shipment secretly, suspected to include drones like ""Muhajer 6"" and ""Ababil 3,"" along with anti-tank missiles. Despite attempts to conceal the flight path by disabling air tracking systems, data from ""Flight Radar 24"" showed the plane made a round trip to Port Sudan on the same day. European intelligence sources confirmed that these weapons are intended for the Sudanese army to use against the ""Rapid Support Forces"" in the ongoing internal conflict. This is not the first time this plane has been used for similar operations, having been involved in arms transport missions in the past year. Satellite images and reports have shown Iranian drones used in the Sudanese civil war, alongside the presence of ""Saeqeh 2"" missiles in Sudanese army camps. This move is part of Iran's efforts to strengthen its military influence in the Red Sea region, with diplomatic and military actions indicating broader objectives beyond military support, potentially involving access to uranium reserves in Sudan to support its nuclear program, as analyzed by the ""Iranian Diplomat"" website close to Tehran. The government of Port Sudan, aligned with General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, restored relations with Iran in late 2023 amid escalating conflict in Gaza, paving the way for the return of Iranian arms shipments. These developments coincided with Iranian offers to provide the Sudanese government with warships in exchange for establishing naval bases, offers officially rejected but not halting the flow of military shipments.",

""I am now completing my second visit to the United States in two months. A very warm visit with my friend President Donald Trump.

You could be impressed by the great closeness and great friendship between us, and it is expressed in the issues we discussed.

First of all - Iran. We agree that Iran will not have nuclear weapons. This can be done in an agreement, but only if this agreement is a Libya-style agreement; that we go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision and American execution - that is good.

A second option, that it will not happen. They will simply drag out the talks, and then the option is military. Everyone understands that. We discussed that at length.

A second issue we discussed - Gaza. We are determined to eliminate Hamas, and at the same time we are determined to return all our hostages.

And the president looked at me and said to the reporters there: 'This man is working all the time to free the hostages.' I hope that with this he has shattered the lie that is spread all the time in the news that I am not working for them, that I do not care.
I care, and I am doing it, and we will succeed in it.

We also talked about President Trump's vision, because we are currently in contact with countries that are talking about the possibility of absorbing a great many Gazans. This is important, because in the end this is what needs to happen.

The third issue - Turkey. Turkey wants to establish military bases in Syria, and this is a danger to Israel.

We oppose this, we are working against this. I told President Trump, who is my friend, also a friend of Erdogan: 'If we need your help - we will talk to you about it.'

And the fourth and final issue - tariffs. President Trump asked the countries to reduce their trade deficit with the United States to zero. I told him: 'It is not that difficult for us. ""We'll do it."" It's the least we can do for the United States and its president, who do so much for us.

It was a very good visit, a very warm visit, and there are other things you'll hear about later.""",
