The Holocaust teaches a fundamental strategic lesson: Some forms of evil must be completely defeated and eradicated. Even if a partial victory could neutralize the threat and save lives, certain ideologies are so dangerous that they must not be allowed to persist in any governing state.

In World War II, Western Allies lost approximately 70,000 soldiers in battles on German soil, while the Soviets lost 80,000 in the Berlin campaign alone. These 150,000 soldiers might have survived had the Allies accepted a peace treaty that left Germany demilitarized, diminished, and defeated. Such an agreement would have required only one concession: allowing the Nazi state to continue existing. This could have secured a superficial peace, but the Allies rejected it.

At the war’s end, the Nazi regime was willing to negotiate such a ""surrender,"" but the Allies refused. They understood that the Nazi state’s survival, in any form, was unacceptable. To achieve its complete destruction, Allied leaders were prepared to sacrifice 150,000 soldiers’ lives—a decision that also prolonged suffering for German civilians.

This lesson applies even more urgently to the Hamas-controlled state in Gaza.

Hamas’s regime in Gaza surpasses Nazi Germany in its extremism. Its ideology, rooted in violence and intolerance, enjoys significant support among Gaza’s population, arguably exceeding the support for Nazism in Germany. Hamas’s actions, such as the Simchat Torah attack, reflect a reckless and destructive fanaticism that outstrips even the Nazis’ calculated aggression. If World War II was a brutal but strategic endeavor, Hamas’s attacks are dangerously irrational by comparison.

If Nazi Germany’s survival was unthinkable, the continued existence of Hamas’s regime in Gaza is equally unacceptable. It must be completely dismantled as a governing entity. No other outcome can legitimately end our conflict with this regime.

India announces strong measures against Pakistan following yesterday’s deadly terror attack against Hindu tourists (26 killed) by Islamist terrorists from Pakistan:

1. Cancelling visas for all Pakistanis
2. Suspends Indus Waters Treaty (1960)
3. Closes the Wagah border crossing

- Pakistan has previously stated that terminating the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) could amount to an act of war.

The World Bank-brokered agreement allocates the waters of 6 rivers in the Indus Basin. 

India controls the eastern rivers (Sutlej, Beas, Ravi) with unrestricted use, while Pakistan has primary rights over the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab), though India can use them for non-consumptive purposes like hydropower. 

If India starts blocking access to water from all 6 rivers, Pakistan will be hit by a water scarcity crisis and its economy will be in serious trouble as 70% of Pakistan’s water needs are covered by these rivers.

Pakistan’s Punjab and Sindh provinces, key agricultural hubs, would face severe water shortages followed by reduced crop yields, food insecurity, and economic losses. 

- The Wagah border crossing, near Amritsar (India) and Lahore (Pakistan), is a key trade and cultural link, famous for its daily flag-lowering ceremony. Closing the vital trade route will particularly impact trade in agricultural products and cement. 

Pakistan will instead have to rely on costlier routes via third countries or ports, increasing import costs and inflation. The Lahore region will face immediate economic hardship, unemployment and potential social unrest.

Hamas has used these vehicles for planting explosives, digging underground routes, breaching fences, and clearing rubble to locate weapons and military equipment hidden by the terrorist organization beneath the rubble. The engineering vehicles that were targeted are a central component in Hamas' ability to carry out terror operations against IDF troops and the State of Israel.
During the murderous massacre on October 7th, the engineering unit of Hamas, which was responsible for breaching the security barrier between Israel and the Gaza Strip, used engineering vehicles to enable the passage of armed terrorists in trucks and on motorcycles into Israeli territory. During the October 7th massacre, dozens of breaches were made using engineering vehicles, including the construction of improvised bridges and the planting of explosives to break through the security barrier.
The strike was carried out to disrupt another capability of the Hamas terrorist organization. The IDF and ISA will continue to operate against terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip in order to eliminate any threat to the citizens of the State of Israel.",

Al-Jamaa al-Islamiya, also known as the Islamic Group, is a Sunni Islamist political party in Lebanon, established in 1964 as the Lebanese branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Its military arm, the al-Fajr Forces, has been involved in launching attacks against Israel, frequently in coordination with Hamas.

As for armed groups in Lebanon, here are the main militias and terrorist-designated organizations:

1️⃣ Hezbollah
2️⃣ Hamas
3️⃣ Palestinian Factions: Groups like Fatah, PFLP, DFLP, Osbat al-Ansar, and others operate inside refugee camps.
4️⃣ Al-Jamaa al-Islamiya (Islamic Group)
5️⃣ Islamic State (ISIS) Cells: Small pockets of ISIS-affiliated cells, mostly in border regions or uncovered in raids.
6️⃣ Al-Qaeda/HTS Affiliates: Occasionally present through splinter factions or individuals, especially in the past near the Syrian border.

So, Lebanon currently harbors at least 6 types of armed factions or militias, with most of them considered terrorist organizations by the international community.

Earlier today (Sunday), the IAF conducted an intelligence-based strike on the terrorist Hussein Ali Nasr, who served as deputy head of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400.

As part of this effort, he collaborated with Iranian operatives to facilitate the transfer of weapons and funds into Lebanon, including through the Beirut International Airport. 

Nasr maintained contact with employees of the airport who secretly operate for Hezbollah and assist with smuggling operations. In addition, he promoted and led weapons procurement deals with smugglers along the Syria-Lebanon border. Moreover, he oversaw the terrorist organizations' reinforcement and military build-up process.

“Well for the Europeans they have an important decision to make very soon on the snapback of sanctions because Iran is clearly out of compliance with the current deal,” Rubio said.

“As you saw, the IAEA was in Tehran yesterday, uh, issued public statements saying Iran is as close as it's ever been to nuclear weapons,” he added.

“The president's made clear Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. That is not going to happen.”

“We're hoping that talks continue and that they're fruitful and that they can lead to something. We would all prefer a peaceful resolution and a lasting one,” Rubio said.

“It has to be something that actually not just prevents Iran from having a nuclear weapon now, but in the future as well — not just for 10 years with some sort of sunset provision or the like.”

“So we discussed that obviously because the Europeans, the E3, have a decision to make on snapback.”

“I believe we should all anticipate, based on the public comments yesterday, that they're about to get a report from the IAEA that says not just is Iran out of compliance, but Iran is dangerously close to a weapon — closer than they've ever been.”

“They're going to have to make a decision about whether they want to reimpose these sanctions. And, uh, you know, if Iran is out of compliance, they have to reimpose the sanctions.”

But the legal standards do not change. Every action must meet the test of military necessity. Every strike must be tied to a legitimate objective. The presence of civilians demands restraint, even when facing an adversary that deliberately exploits them.
Necessary War, Constrained Conduct
So, was Israel’s war against Hamas necessary?
That depends on which kind of necessity you mean. But in truth, it meets both tests:
Was the war morally necessary? After October 7th—following the deliberate massacre of civilians, the kidnapping of hostages, and Hamas’s declared intention to repeat those atrocities—the answer is unequivocally yes.
Are Israel’s military operations legally necessary? While each strike must meet specific legal thresholds, the IDF operates under one of the most stringent legal and ethical frameworks in modern warfare. It is bound by the law of armed conflict and has demonstrated an unprecedented commitment to minimizing harm, even while engaging an enemy that hides among civilians and violates every rule of war.
A war can be both morally justified and legally constrained. Israel’s campaign against Hamas is exactly that. It was not launched lightly or recklessly—it was waged in defense of life, sovereignty, and the rule of law.
Anyone asking whether Israel’s war was necessary should first understand what they are really asking—and then recognize that the answer, by every standard that matters, is yes.",
53258,2025-04-18 03:28:02,-1001361890342,,,,"Why Israel’s War Against Hamas Is Necessary

By John Spencer and Arsen Ostrovsky


Following Hamas's barbaric October 7th massacre—which killed over 1,200 people in Israel, most of them civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, with over 250 taken hostage—Israel launched a large-scale military campaign in Gaza. The scope and intensity of the response were unprecedented, but so too was the attack that prompted it.
Since then, there has been no shortage of uninformed actors, like comedian Dave Smith, or malign parties weaponizing international law to question whether Israel’s military actions in Gaza have been proportionate, lawful, and ultimately—whether even necessary.
At the heart of that last question lies a critical misunderstanding. ""Necessity"" in war has two distinct meanings and conflating them—morally and legally—leads to flawed assessments and misleading narratives.
Two Necessities: One Moral, One Legal
1. Moral Necessity – The Just War Tradition
The first concept of necessity comes from just war theory, an ethical framework developed over centuries to evaluate whether the use of force can be morally justified (jus ad bellum).
One of its core tenets is necessity:
War must be a last resort, undertaken only after all nonviolent alternatives—diplomacy, deterrence, sanctions, international mediation—have been exhausted.
In the case of Israel, the record speaks for itself. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, dismantling all civilian and military infrastructure. In the years that followed, Hamas seized power in a violent coup, launched tens of thousands of rockets, and rejected every meaningful effort at peaceful coexistence. Despite periodic ceasefires and repeated international mediation, Hamas remained committed not to a Palestinian state alongside Israel—but to Israel’s destruction.
On October 7th, Hamas made its intentions unmistakable. It crossed the border not to challenge Israeli soldiers, but to massacre civilians. It filmed the atrocities and vowed to do it again. In that context, the claim that Israel’s military response lacked moral necessity ignores the facts and defies common sense.
2. Legal Necessity – The Law of Armed Conflict
The second form of necessity is not philosophical but legal. It belongs to the realm of international humanitarian law (IHL)—the rules governing the conduct of war (jus in bello).
Military necessity permits only those actions required to achieve a legitimate military objective.
This principle—codified in the Geneva Conventions, Hague Regulations, and customary international law—does not allow destruction for its own sake. It does not excuse harm to civilians unless it is incidental to a lawful strike. And it certainly does not override the obligations to distinguish between military and civilian targets or to avoid disproportionate attacks.
Every Israeli military operation in Gaza is bound by this standard. It is not enough to identify a Hamas presence in a building or a neighborhood. To strike lawfully, the target must provide a concrete and direct military advantage, and every feasible precaution must be taken to mitigate civilian harm.
Israel’s military attorneys and commanders operate within this framework. Target selection, weapon choice, timing of attack, and warning mechanisms are scrutinized in real time. The IDF not only operates under legal necessity—it documents and reviews its actions at a level few modern militaries do, particularly when fighting a terrorist group embedded in a civilian population.

A useful example from the laws of war helps clarify this distinction.
Destroying a bridge used to transport enemy weapons is a lawful act of military necessity. It offers a clear operational advantage and directly degrades enemy capability. By contrast, destroying a bakery in a residential neighborhood simply because enemy fighters may stop there for food is not. The bakery is not a military objective, and its destruction would serve no legitimate military purpose.
This distinction matters in urban warfare.",

Destruction of Houthi Controlled Ras Isa Fuel Port

The Houthis have continued to benefit economically and militarily from countries and companies that provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. The Iran-backed Houthis use fuel to sustain their military operations, as a weapon of control, and to benefit economically from embezzling the profits from the import. This fuel should be legitimately supplied to the people of Yemen. Despite the Foreign Terrorist Designation that went into effect on 05 April, ships have continued to supply fuel via the port of Ras Isa. Profits from these illegal sales are directly funding and sustaining Houthi terrorist efforts.

Today, US forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years. The objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen. This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.

The Houthis, their Iranian masters, and those who knowingly aid and abet their terrorist actions should be put on notice that the world will not accept illicit smuggling of fuel and war material to a terrorist organization.",

However, it was estimated that the operation that includes commando forces, would not be ready before October, and Israel wanted to act quickly. One reason for the rapid action was the desire to carry out the operation before the commander of CENTCOM, General Michael Erik Kurilla, leaves his post. The new plan, without commandos, proposed that Israel, with US support and assistance, would bomb Iran's nuclear facilities for an entire week, while defending against a large-scale missile attack.

Israel had planned to strike Iranian nuclear sites as early as next month, but President Donald Trump has halted the plan in recent weeks in favor of negotiating a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program, according to U.S. administration officials and others familiar with the discussions.

Trump made his decision after months of internal debate over whether to pursue diplomacy or support Israel in its effort to weaken Iran’s ability to build a nuclear bomb at a time when Tehran’s military and economic power has declined.

The dispute has highlighted divisions between U.S. officials known for their historical hawkish views and other advisers who are more skeptical about the ability of military strikes to eliminate Iran’s nuclear ambitions without triggering a wider war. 

The discussion has produced a rough consensus, for now, against military action, with indications from Iran that it is willing to negotiate.

Israeli officials have recently formulated plans to attack Iranian nuclear sites in May and have been prepared to carry them out, and have even expressed optimism at times that the United States would give its approval. 

According to sources briefed on these proposals, the goal was to slow Tehran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons by a year or more.

Implementing most of these plans would require American assistance, not only to protect Israel from any Iranian response but also to ensure the success of the Israeli attack, making the United States a central part of the operation itself.

Trump has chosen diplomacy over military action for now. In his first term, he withdrew from the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran, but in his second term, in an attempt to avoid a new Middle East war, he began negotiations with Tehran, giving it no more than a few months to reach an agreement on its nuclear program.

Trump informed Israel earlier this month of his decision that the United States would not support a military strike. He discussed the matter with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Washington last week, where he announced in an Oval Office meeting that the United States had begun talks with Iran. 

Netanyahu said in a statement delivered in Hebrew after the meeting that any agreement with Iran would not succeed unless the signatories were allowed “to go in, bomb the facilities, and dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision and enforcement.” 

This report is based on conversations with several officials briefed on secret Israeli military plans and confidential discussions within the Trump administration. Most of the interviewees spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military planning.

Israel has long planned to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, conducting bombing drills and calculating the extent of the damage it could inflict with or without American assistance.

Support for the Israeli government to strike has grown after a series of setbacks suffered by Iran last year.

Most of Iran’s ballistic missiles failed to penetrate U.S. and Israeli defenses in Iran’s attacks on Israel in April, and Hezbollah, Iran’s main ally, was dealt a devastating blow in an Israeli military campaign last year. The subsequent fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria eliminated an ally of Iran and Hezbollah and cut off a major route for arms smuggling from Iran.

Air defense systems in Iran and Syria were also destroyed, along with facilities used by Iran to produce rocket fuel, crippling the country’s ability to produce new missiles for a period of time.

At Netanyahu’s request, senior Israeli officials briefed their American counterparts on a plan that combined an Israeli commando operation against underground nuclear sites with an airstrike campaign, a plan in which the Israelis hoped American aircraft would participate.

But Israeli military officials said the special operation would not be ready until October, while Netanyahu wanted it to be implemented more quickly.",

In fact, the Bible says that as we approach the last days, the love of many will grow cold, and even in the church, people will not seek truth but will have itching ears, chasing what pleases them. We are here to make a difference for the few who have an ear to hear what the Spirit says. We should not grow weary in doing good. Big numbers are not a measure of success—faithfulness is! When we meet the Lord one day, He won’t say, “Well done, famous and successful,” but rather, “Well done, good and faithful servant!”

As the world plunges into deeper, wider, and nastier chaos, we must remember that we were never promised a garden of roses in these last days. We are called to run the race, fight the fight, and keep our faith! The crown of righteousness awaits all who have loved His appearing. Faithfulness in how we live and holding fast to the blessed hope of eagerly awaiting His return—these are what we must strive for.",

Overnight (Sunday), the IDF struck a command and control center that served as a terror infrastructure for terrorists in the area of Daraj Tuffah. The compound contained a weapons storage facility where explosives devices were located that were used by Hamas terrorists to carry out terror attacks against IDF troops.

Over the 48 hours, the IAF struck over 90 terror targets belonging to terrorist organizations throughout the Gaza Strip. Among the targets struck, was the infrastructure from which projectiles were launched yesterday (Saturday). Additionally, the IAF struck weapons storage facilities, terrorist cells, and terrorist infrastructure.

IDF troops continue to operate in the area of Rafah and on the ""Morag"" Corridor. As part of the operation, the troops eliminated terrorists and struck Hamas terrorist infrastructure.

In the areas of Tel Al-Sultan and al-Shaboura, IDF troops located and dismantled weapons, terrorist infrastructure, and tunnel shafts.

In northern Gaza, IDF troops struck and dismantled terrorist infrastructure and tunnel shafts, and eliminated during an airstrike several terrorists who attempted to plant an explosive device in the ground.",
53062,2025-04-13 12:34:37,-1001361890342,,,,"Overnight, the IDF was forced to conduct a military operation within the Al Ahli Hospital in northern Gaza.

Conducting such military operations in war time, is very grave matter. But what does int’l law say about this, and when do hospitals become legitimate military targets?

Under International Humanitarian Law, it is a foundational principle that hospitals receive special protected status. See for example, Art. 18 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Art. 8 of the Rome Statute, as well as customary int’l law.

However, the laws of armed conflict are also pragmatic enough to recognize there are exceptional circumstances in times of war, in which hospitals may lose such special status.

In short, this protection ceases if hospitals are “used to commit hostile acts” or for military purposes.

See specifically Art. 8(2) of the Rome Statute, Art. 19 of the 4th Geneva Convention or Art. 11 of the 2nd Protocol to the Geneva Conventions.

In this case, intelligence indicated the Al Ahli hospital compound was being used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers, therefore causing the hospital to lose its protected status and turning it into a legitimate military target.

We know, as an indispensable fact now, that Hamas systematically embeds their operations and terrorist fighters in hospitals, using civilians as human shields and hospitals as their command centers.

However, merely because Hamas has seized hospitals as its own personal launching pads, does not provide carte blanche for Israel to conduct military operations. Under humanitarian law, Israel must still abide by fundamental rules such as distinction, proportionality and precaution. In each case, it has acted in accordance with its obligation. 

Israel also took ample precaution, including providing advanced warning and helping facilitate the evacuation of civilians, staff and patients.

The IDF also used precision weapons, in order to mitigate any potential harm to civilians or to the hospital compound.

Quite simply, Israel has gone to unprecedented lengths to comply with its obligations pursuant to the law of armed conflict, whereas Hamas is doing everything possible in order to violate those laws and maximize casualties.

It should also be noted that Al Ahli is the same hospital that on October 17th, 2023, Islamic Jihad fired a missle and then accused Israel for it - which the int’l community and press immediately rushed to blindly parrot.

Those who truly care about the wellbeing of civilians in Gaza, and who are rightfully aghast at the scenes coming out of Al Alhi Hospital would be well advised to direct their outrage at Hamas, which continues to unconscionably and illegally turn hospitals into their personal control and command centers and severely risk the lives of innocent civilians.

Because the Iranian regime is weaker and fearful more than ever, And - this could also be one of the greatest diplomatic deception operations we’ve seen.

Khamenei is at the weakest point of his rule since assuming power in June 1989. In his recent public appearances, he has appeared pale and dejected - especially when compared to the early months following October 7.  It’s no surprise. His life’s work, the network of Iranian proxy militias - has suffered a major blow: operationally, geopolitically and strategically. Billions of dollars of Iranian public funds have gone to waste. 
But beyond that, the Iranian people as a whole are in a dire situation - one that threatens domestic stability and risks sparking a wide-scale uprising that could endanger the regime’s survival. Alongside severe repression, human rights violations, and mass executions, Iran today faces a reality with no clean water, no electricity, no gas, no clean air, and no money. The economy is in ruins, the currency is at a historic low, and over one-third of the population lives below the poverty line Khamenei does not want to be remembered as the leader under whose watch the regime collapsed. When the house is burning, you do whatever it takes to save yourself first - even if it means humiliating yourself before your greatest enemy. And naturally, this is the perfect moment for the Shia concept of Taqiyya - deception and dishonesty for the sake of self-preservation and advancing one’s interests. It would be naïve to believe they are abandoning their ideology or plans. 
Can a Persian leopard change its spots? They are stalling for time because they know there won’t be another Donald Trump. They are the children of hardship and the Ramadan. Difficulty is no stranger to them. And the regime still has oil, gold, and crypto in abundance to keep its head above water and continue repressing dissent.

There’s no point in viewing this situation through a lens of rationality. “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” aren’t just slogans - it’s their raison d'etre and a pure Ideology. The regime wants to survive - but it also wants to destroy Israel, and it has been working on that since the day it was founded. It seeks to spread Shia Islam into moderate Sunni nations, and for years it has been working to create chaos in those societies. An agreement at this moment would be a historic lifeline to a regime at its weakest point ever - and a crushing blow to the Iranian people and to the Middle East.

It’s very clear: as long as this regime stands, there will never be peace in the Middle East.

The same army that received drones from Iran and handed over control of Sudan’s port to China (because apparently, national sovereignty is overrated) is now eyeing the rest of Africa as a dumping ground for their knockoff destruction, cheap goods, deadly results.

Here’s the punchline: the Sudanese army is being led by Omar al-Bashir and Ahmed Haroun, both indicted war criminals by the ICC, both with blood on their hands, both Islamist terrorists who orchestrated genocide and murdered over half a million people. These two clowns are not in hiding; they’re running the army and the foreign ministry, like it’s some twisted comedy.

Interestingly enough, Intelligence information obtained by ""Iran International"" revealed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard sent a weapons shipment to Sudan on March 17th via a cargo plane belonging to ""Fars Air Qeshm,"" a company under international sanctions. The plane, a Boeing 747 with the registration code ""EP-FAB,"" took off from Tehran to Port Sudan, delivering the shipment secretly, suspected to include drones like ""Muhajer 6"" and ""Ababil 3,"" along with anti-tank missiles. Despite attempts to conceal the flight path by disabling air tracking systems, data from ""Flight Radar 24"" showed the plane made a round trip to Port Sudan on the same day. European intelligence sources confirmed that these weapons are intended for the Sudanese army to use against the ""Rapid Support Forces"" in the ongoing internal conflict. This is not the first time this plane has been used for similar operations, having been involved in arms transport missions in the past year. Satellite images and reports have shown Iranian drones used in the Sudanese civil war, alongside the presence of ""Saeqeh 2"" missiles in Sudanese army camps. This move is part of Iran's efforts to strengthen its military influence in the Red Sea region, with diplomatic and military actions indicating broader objectives beyond military support, potentially involving access to uranium reserves in Sudan to support its nuclear program, as analyzed by the ""Iranian Diplomat"" website close to Tehran. The government of Port Sudan, aligned with General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, restored relations with Iran in late 2023 amid escalating conflict in Gaza, paving the way for the return of Iranian arms shipments. These developments coincided with Iranian offers to provide the Sudanese government with warships in exchange for establishing naval bases, offers officially rejected but not halting the flow of military shipments.",

""I am now completing my second visit to the United States in two months. A very warm visit with my friend President Donald Trump.

You could be impressed by the great closeness and great friendship between us, and it is expressed in the issues we discussed.

First of all - Iran. We agree that Iran will not have nuclear weapons. This can be done in an agreement, but only if this agreement is a Libya-style agreement; that we go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision and American execution - that is good.

A second option, that it will not happen. They will simply drag out the talks, and then the option is military. Everyone understands that. We discussed that at length.

A second issue we discussed - Gaza. We are determined to eliminate Hamas, and at the same time we are determined to return all our hostages.

And the president looked at me and said to the reporters there: 'This man is working all the time to free the hostages.' I hope that with this he has shattered the lie that is spread all the time in the news that I am not working for them, that I do not care.
I care, and I am doing it, and we will succeed in it.

We also talked about President Trump's vision, because we are currently in contact with countries that are talking about the possibility of absorbing a great many Gazans. This is important, because in the end this is what needs to happen.

The third issue - Turkey. Turkey wants to establish military bases in Syria, and this is a danger to Israel.

We oppose this, we are working against this. I told President Trump, who is my friend, also a friend of Erdogan: 'If we need your help - we will talk to you about it.'

And the fourth and final issue - tariffs. President Trump asked the countries to reduce their trade deficit with the United States to zero. I told him: 'It is not that difficult for us. ""We'll do it."" It's the least we can do for the United States and its president, who do so much for us.

It was a very good visit, a very warm visit, and there are other things you'll hear about later.""",

This year, we are operating on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, where conditions are even more extreme. The snow is deeper, the cold more severe, and the terrain more dangerous than ever before. These challenges demand the highest level of preparedness, skill, and specialized equipment.

Our soldiers are trained and equipped for these demanding conditions. However, due to the increasing intensity of the mission, upgrading to advanced, life saving gear specifically designed for extreme cold and mountainous terrain is now critical to ensure both safety and operational success.

As the only unit of its kind in Israel, the Alpinist Unit operates under the harshest winter conditions in the country. Your support can make a meaningful impact, strengthening our capabilities and helping us fulfill our mission with the highest level of effectiveness.

Thank you for standing with us in protecting Israel and its future.",

9. Netanyahu’s Objectives:  
   - Prevent a nuclear Iran.  
   - Define a zonal border with Turkey in Syria.  
   - Secure territorial changes in Judea and Samaria, Gaza, southern Lebanon, and parts of Syria.  
   - Forge a trade agreement with the US.  
   - Deepen military partnership.  
   - Finalize the Abraham Accords.

10. The Age of Great Powers: We’re in an era of superpower warfare, allied with the most powerful nation in human history. Israel is well-positioned but must remain patient. The stakes are high, and errors on this vast map are unforgivable.

Good luck to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If his meeting with the US president succeeds, Israel will enter a new, unprecedented era for the better.

(Topaz Ram)",
52803,2025-04-07 00:35:27,-1001361890342,,,,"The War of the Superpowers: Bombers and Tariffs

Anyone who analyzes Trump’s tariffs through the lens of ""cost of living"" or ""the stock market"" is deluding themselves. The world is changing. The future of nations will not hinge on cost-of-living metrics or stock indices in Tel Aviv and New York but on military, industrial, and technological power. This is the war of the superpowers—the defining trend. There’s a direct link between the US, the European Union, China, and jihadists in the Middle East.

The studios, commentators, journalists, and politicians don’t grasp that the world is shifting. We’re entering a war of superpowers where every misstep or act of arrogance courts destruction. The ultimate aim is control and balance.

Now, an explanation of tariffs and the War of Nations:

1. America’s Core Conflict: 
The supreme struggle is with China. Europe was meant to compete alongside the US as part of the democratic world but has failed against industrial China and military Russia. For the free world’s sake, industries must return to America and pro-American nations—like India and Israel—that value life.
The American economy thrives on technology, not industry. Europe has drained industries from the US, not wealth. America’s stock market is dominated by tech giants, while Europe leans on industry. If the American consumer suffers, Europe will collapse entirely.

2. Europe’s Dependency: 
Britain, France, and all of Europe lack a right to exist without the US. Without it, Europe would bow to Turkey, cower before Russia, and see the Mediterranean, the Straits of Gibraltar, and even the Vatican threatened by ISIS, just as the Houthis disrupted the Red Sea.

3. Tariffs as Strategy: Tariffs are a geostrategic move. Just as Trump positioned bombers over Iran, he’s placing economic ""bombers"" over Europe’s economy.  
Trump—a president hounded by the Deep State, survivor of an assassination attempt—faces a post-Biden world. Without urgent change, the free world will perish.

4. Economic Illusions: 
The American economy is a bluff; Europe’s is an even bigger one. Birth rates are plummeting, debts are soaring. Germany, Britain, and France obsess over climate issues and stay silent as their debt-ridden economies falter, with Muslims now the largest minority. The ""Free Palestine"" slogan is propaganda that exposes the monstrous consequences of Europe’s open gates.

5. A New World Order: 
America has no inherent right to its current global political and economic dominance. A new order must emerge. Is this America’s fault? Superpowers don’t dwell on guilt or apologies—they seek control.  
Post-World War II support for Europe stemmed from its role as a US proxy against the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union is gone, and Russia poses neither an economic nor a direct political threat to the US. China is the true economic and political rival. Europe, meanwhile, is not just an industrial competitor but an economic liability. Alliances are always temporary in history. Why not bolster India and Israel instead?

6. Long-Term Vision: 
Trump is ""destroying the economy""? Hardly. He’s thinking 100 years ahead. The future lies with India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Africa—not with nations debating climate and gender in parliament while committing slow suicide.

7. Warning to Israelis in Europe: 
Return home now. You’re gambling with fire for cheap cherries. The EU is a debt-ridden economy that can’t meet industrial or security demands. France, the EU’s number-two economy, could trigger a collapse of the EU and the euro if it fails. Living in the Czech Republic, Spain, Portugal, or Greece? You’re not safe. You’re tied to France’s fate. At best, assets and finances will be nationalized; at worst, anti-Semitism will erupt in the streets.  
Unlike 2008, when Germany bailed out Greece (a small player), no one will save France. Poverty will hit hard, bringing wars, anti-Semitism, and Islamism. Assets will be seized, taxes will skyrocket, and conscription orders will follow.",

1. MILITARY ARM:

- Liberate occupied Muslim lands from non-Islamic governance. 
- Rule Islamic territories through force-backed Sharia implementation.
- Expand the borders of Dar al-Islam by conquest, terror, and warfare.
- Strike fear into the hearts of disbelievers.
- Destroy minorities, punish apostates, and dismantle any resistance to Allah’s law.
- Obey the divine call to wage jihad until all religion is for Allah.

2. POLITICAL ARM:

- Control parliaments and city councils. 
- Infiltrate Western legal and democratic systems using rights language and civil liberties against themselves.
- Write, influence, and lobby for constitutions aligned with Islamic values.
- Push blasphemy and hate speech laws to criminalize criticism of Islam.
- Weaponize identity politics (race, gender, post-colonial guilt) to silence opposition.
- Defend terrorists as freedom fighters under the guise of “resistance.”
- Recruit useful idiots to serve the cause. 

3. RELIGIOUS ARM:

- Educate and indoctrinate from the pulpit, classroom, and prison cell.
- Equip new missionaries, scholars, and legal jihadists. 
- Ignite emotional and spiritual fire in Muslim youth with identity-driven rhetoric.
- Sustain ideological zeal through Friday sermons, fatwas, and community control.
- Provide logistical support for conversions, cultural takeover, and legal preparation for Sharia norms.

4. FINANCIAL ARM:

- Fund Islamic media empires to control narrative and perception.
- Pour billions into universities to shape curriculums and silence criticism.
- Buy influence with bribes, donations, and diplomatic pressure.
- Control key companies and sectors through Islamic finance and business networks.
- Sponsor scholarships and fellowships for Muslims in politics, law, academia, and journalism.
- Use state power to bankroll jihad, soft and hard.

5. The Human Infrastructure:

- Outbreed the natives, weaponize birthrates to tip demographic scales.
- Use immigration as a vanguard tool to plant flags in non-Muslim lands.
- Islamize neighborhoods, schools, and cities through sheer numbers and cultural insistence.
- Convert the disillusioned, Latinos, African Americans, women, with identity politics and false empowerment.
- Form voting blocs, school boards, and social coalitions to build influence from the ground up.
- Serve as cultural enforcers, silencing critics, mobilizing outrage, and normalizing Sharia expectations.",

That is, the US has a trade deficit with Israel of 7 billion dollars. The administration's calculation is 7 (the trade deficit) divided by 20 (Israeli exports to the US) equals 33. This number was divided in half in accordance with Trump's decision regarding the global calculation method, and the resulting number (after rounding up), 17, is the tariff rate that was decided to be imposed on imports from Israel.

Trump is doing what he believes is best for his country,  the USA.
So why are we making this election about Trump?

The Liberals got us into this mess.
Not Trump.
Not Conservatives.
Not China.
Not Ontario - Not BC - Not Quebec! 

The Liberals.

They gave us a 69-cent dollar.
They gave us broken healthcare.
They let in 4 million refugees without a plan.
They legalized hard drugs and watched our streets rot.
They doubled our national debt and blamed everyone else.

Trump didn’t do any of that.
The Liberals did.
And now they want another term?

This election isn’t about the USA.
It’s not about Trump.
It’s about Canada.
It’s about change.
It’s about making the Liberals pay at the polls...and giving Canada back to All!",

Our world has come full circle—from the literal Days of Noah to an era reminiscent of those times. This isn’t just about a world detached from God, obsessed with making a name for itself; it also signals the endgame—the imminent, sudden removal of the righteous from the realm of the unrighteous, followed by the severe judgment of the latter. We are living in the final hours of the world as we know it, echoing the last days of Noah.  
This is the last chapter!  
This is the moment where the story of your life can still change, where you can switch sides to join those who will be removed and thus escape the judgment.

""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.  
He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation: that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.""

Amid an unusual concentration of American forces in the Middle East, many are wondering whether a military strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities is imminent. However, beneath the radar, a war has already begun—one that is economic, paralyzing, and devastating.

In the last three months, the United States has launched a full-scale economic war against Iran. Immediately upon Donald Trump’s return to the White House, crippling sanctions were imposed on the Islamic Republic. Chief among them is a clear threat: any company that leases an oil tanker to Iran or any port in the world that unloads Iranian oil will face U.S. blacklisting.

Collapse from Within: A Disintegrating Economy, Citizens in Crisis

The Iranian rial, the local currency, is plummeting uncontrollably. As of now, it trades at around 1,039,000 rials to the dollar—a drop of more than 30% in just the past three months. The implication is stark: to purchase basic goods, Iranian citizens must carry bags full of cash. This is a failing economy by every measure.

Official inflation is reported at 30–40%, though unofficial estimates suggest it is even higher. Under such conditions, an economy cannot function—it simply collapses.

Infrastructure Collapse and the Threat of Nationwide Multi-Front Chaos
Iran is grappling with:
- A severe water crisis: Approximately 35 million residents face water shortages due to mismanagement and severe drought.
- Power shortages: Planned blackouts and crumbling infrastructure persist, despite Iran sitting atop vast gas reserves.
- A weakened regular army: The proxy project has drained Iran’s economic resources, leaving little to invest in its air force, logistics, or manpower.

What Does This Mean?
Iran shares a land border spanning roughly 5,600 kilometers with seven countries and is surrounded by a diverse ethnic mix along its frontiers. Many of these minority groups view themselves as distinct entities separate from the Persian state.

The combination of failing water systems, electricity shortages, and a weakened military could precipitate Iran’s collapse. A crisis in energy, infrastructure, water, and the regular army is creating security and civilian tensions that destabilize peripheral regions far from Tehran.

Tehran’s ability to maintain control over its territory is limited. The same reason President Raisi died when his helicopter was lost—poor infrastructure and coordination—illustrates why Iran would struggle to deploy forces across the country to maintain order.

Iran is becoming increasingly vulnerable to rebellions, crime, and terrorism along its vast borders. It is effectively trapped in a dictatorial bubble: it lacks funds, its situation is deteriorating, and more resources are being diverted to suppress its own people.

A Breaking Point
Iran cannot sustain this status quo. It is panicked and fearful, fully aware that if it does not reach an agreement with Trump, it risks a genuine economic collapse. Yet, if it does sign a serious deal, it would signal the end of the regime—shattering it on a theological level as well.

Iran is in an extremely dire situation. This presents a strategic opportunity for Israel and the United States.

The truly interesting news to me isn’t from the impressive bombers, but from the gray areas—less obvious moves with big implications.

In recent days, India, unlike the rest of the industrialized world, has been among the few countries Trump hasn’t targeted in his trade war. There’s a reason for this: India is poised to become the world’s cheap-labor manufacturer, replacing China.

If, in 10-20 years, India relies on Iranian oil instead of Saudi oil, that’s not good for the U.S. After all, as a superpower, you’re not just being nice. Your goal is control: ensuring the country producing your goods (India) buys energy from a country that buys weapons from you (Saudi Arabia), with all products and energy flowing through a trade route (Israel) under your influence.

This is how superpowers operate. They don’t aim to score the most goals—they aim to buy the league. Trump’s secondary goal in the trade war, alongside restoring American industry, is to engineer industries, natural resources, and trade routes to America’s benefit.

For years, American presidents have preferred a “nuclear Iran over the spectrum.”  
1. Democrats supported this because they wanted to pull Iran away from China.  
2. Republicans opposed it because they wanted to separate Russia from China.  
Along the way, Arab countries and Israel joined forces, bought weapons, and made agreements under U.S. auspices.

President Trump, unlike previous American presidents and even his own approach since 2016, is serious about Iran because the trade war is his top priority. The old policy of “maintaining power and the balance of terror”—allowing Iran to inch toward nuclear weapons while keeping Arab countries and Israel in check—is no longer relevant. If China invests billions in Iran, if the Houthis (backed by Iran) block shipping routes, if Iran flirts with India, if Hezbollah threatens gas rigs—Iran is stepping head-on into Trump’s superpower war.

The policy of containing Iran worked in a different era: before the U.S. became an energy powerhouse, before the Abraham Accords, before the Russia-Ukraine war, before Iran proved with the Houthis that it could disrupt trade routes, and before Western European radicalism shifted the landscape.

Iran sits between China and India. It’s a country that, just by selling energy, could dominate Asia and become a power in its own right. In the era of the trade war—where the U.S. seeks to control trade routes like the Panama Canal, Greenland, and the Abraham Accords’ envisioned route through Israel —Iran cannot exist as anything but a clear American proxy. Otherwise, it’s an energy threat.

This is the same reason the Trump administration is serious about the Gaza Strip.  
The same reason he’s serious about Greenland and Panama.  
This is how serious the Trump administration is about Iran.

We’re in an era of superpower warfare, and the U.S. goal is to dominate everything related to industrial, energy, and logistical trade.

In my opinion: Trump is very serious.

With respect for your position and the people of Iran, I write this message to you with the aim of opening new horizons for our relations, far from the years of conflict and misunderstandings we have witnessed in past decades. The time has come to abandon enmity and open a new chapter based on mutual cooperation and respect. Today, too, there is a historic opportunity before us.

The United States, under my leadership, is ready to take a major step toward peace and easing tensions. We can work together to lift sanctions, empower the Iranian economy, and open the doors of cooperation between our countries. This is not only in the interest of our peoples, but also in the interest of stability and peace in the Middle East and the entire world.

But I warn you — if you reject this outstretched hand, and if the Iranian regime chooses the path of escalation and continued support for terrorist organizations and military adventures, then our response will be decisive and swift. We will not remain idle in the face of your regime’s threats to our people or our allies.

Peace is not weakness. It is the choice of the strong. The Iranian people are a great people who deserve a better future, far from isolation, poverty, and suffering.

If you are ready to negotiate, we are ready too. But if you persist in ignoring the demands of the world, history will record that you missed a tremendous opportunity.

With respect.""

A NATO Threat Rising on Israel’s Border? 

Syria and Turkey are negotiating a dangerous deal: transferring control of key territory near Palmyra—once a stronghold for Iranian-backed militias—in exchange for Turkish military and economic support.

Turkey is planning to establish an airbase in central Syria to host F-16 fighter jets. If the U.S. greenlights Turkey’s reentry into the F-35 program, the threat intensifies dramatically.

This would put a heavily armed NATO-member force, equipped with advanced U.S. technology, deep inside Syria—within striking distance of Israel.

Some are calling it a greater threat to Israel than even Iran.

This cannot be allowed to happen. There must be a proactive approach—not the usual reactive pattern Israel has fallen into.

If this isn’t addressed now, a direct military clash between Israel and Turkey is inevitable.

And the U.S. must wake up to reality: one of their own NATO allies is on a collision course with Israel.

The head of the ruling military junta in Myanmar announced that he had authorized China and India to send aid to the country, saying that ""there will be more casualties, I invite every country to help and contribute.""

Worse, they are perpetuating an age-old victimhood narrative that is endemic in the Palestinian national project, refusing to take any responsibility for actions, blaming all of the Palestinian people’s ills on Israel, and acting as if no one or nothing else is even partly responsible for the disaster in Gaza.

The target audience of these so-called journalists or “activists” are not the people of Gaza; instead, it is clueless and ideological people in the diaspora, non-Palestinians, and outsiders who are brainlessly cheering on a terrorist militia simply because it’s claiming to “resist” Israel. Take good notice of all of these characters now and tabulate who is with the people of Gaza VS. who is with a narrow narrative that merely uses the people of Gaza to gather likes, follows, shares, and clout, all while undermining the very interests of Palestinians in the coastal enclave.

Promoting Palestinian accountability, responsibility, introspection, and soul-searching is necessary and courageous to bolster the chances of obtaining freedom and liberation.

As a reminder, the previous governor of the Lebanese Central Bank was the notorious Riad Salameh, who served for thirty years and left office in July 2023 amid serious corruption charges against him both in Lebanon and abroad. He was later arrested. Salameh was replaced by his deputy, Wasim Mansouri.

In late June of '24, according to the IAEA, Iran began placing 135 new centrifuges online. The IAEA concluded that once complete, Iran could build several nuclear weapons in less than 1 month. 

In Feb of '25, the IAEA published a new report detailing two locations where the presence of anthropogenic (human-altered) uranium was detected. Iran had not disclosed to the IAEA those two locations, and has unaccounted for uranium. This would mean Iran is not in compliance with the NPT.

Hamas issued new list of 50,021 fatalities. Findings: (a) Fatalities age 13-55 are 72% men (b) Teen soldiers confirmed; males=65% of deaths age 13-17 (c) Natural deaths are ~8,300 of total fatalities. (4) IDF targeted combatants; NO genocide. Analysis: 

As in prior lists, well known use by Hamas & PIJ of teen combatants as young as 13 is confirmed, with 65% of teen fatalities male. There are ~1,500 excess teen combatants recorded (Silence, of course, from so-called NGOs). Under age 10, fatalities close to 50-50 male/female. 

At this point it is certain natural deaths & infant mortality are included in the Hamas fatality list. After 16 months, Hamas and its ""Ministry of Health"" does not have a hidden separate list of natural deaths. These are ~8,300 since 10/7, based on historical data for Gaza. 

This means that deaths from war since 10/7 are about 41,700, per Hamas, after subtracting natural deaths. IDF has stated it has killed ~20,000 combatants, once again resulting in about a 1:1 civilian/combatant ratio – probably lower taking into account Hamas caused deaths. 

Yes, there have been ~60,000 births in Gaza annually since 10/7 per UN & NGO data. Hamas list says 876 infants died since 10/7, matching expected infant mortality, corroborating inclusion of natural deaths. No, Hamas is not keeping a hidden separate list of infant mortality. 

What about women & children killed? After subtracting natural deaths & infant mortality, total is about 40% of war fatalities, far lower than 70% or “most” thus contradicting common but false narrative of war. Still high & tragic but ALL Hamas' fault. 

Note that Hamas’ list shows 15,000 excess male deaths of combatant age. I believe several thousand additional combatant deaths have not been disclosed, some in the tunnels and under rubble. At this point even Hamas admits that the IDF mainly targeted males of combat age.
