At the recent boxing event, Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez confidently defeated William Scurry, reaffirming his status as the undisputed world champion in the super-middleweight division. Canelo retains four titles — WBA, WBC, WBO, and IBF — and once again proves that his place is at the top of world boxing 💪

Before this fight, Alvarez became a new ambassador for 1win — a brand that bets on the strongest. And this choice turned out to be more than symbolic.

The victory in Riyadh is not just another win in his record, but yet another confirmation: Canelo is not just a champion, he is an era — and 1win is becoming part of this story 🏆
